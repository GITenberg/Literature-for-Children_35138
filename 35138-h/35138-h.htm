<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> book is about books of literature. Its excuse
for being at all is in the over-reading of books that
are not literature. Confusion and hurry confront both
child and teacher in the land of books. The hope is
held that something can be done to lead the child out
of this confusion.</p>

<p>There is no greater possibility existing in the child's
educational life than the possibility of self-cultivation
in the reading of great books. Nor has there ever
been a greater need for the quiet reading of such
books than in a time of wonderful mechanical invention.
Shall a boy fly or shall he read? It seems both
fair and possible to say that he may fly but he must
read. Whatever be the line of work he chooses to
follow, he will have spare hours. His contribution to
the life of his community and the rounding out of his
individual life are dependent very largely on the wise
use of these spare hours. Some spare hours may be
given to music or the theatre, some to social entertainment,
some to outdoor sports, some to church aid work;
but some must surely be given to the reading of great
books.</p>

<p>The following pages attempt to set the boy on the
right trail, so that when he reaches man's estate he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
will of his own accord devote a just portion of his
spare hours to books of literature. To do this, attention
needs to be given to these practices: the learning
of a little choice poetry by heart, the learning of a few
fairy stories and myths through the ear, the reading
and rereading of a few great books, the saving of
money to build up a small but well-selected private
bookshelf, the practice of reading aloud by the fireside
or in the schoolroom. The chances are that a
boy so directed will find reading a pleasure and will
turn to what is really worth while. The attempt by
parents and teachers to bring about an abiding love
for books of power is a most commendable attempt;
and, if successful, the best contribution to a refined
private life. To all such attempts these pages aim to
contribute.</p>

<p>The preparation of these pages has been made easier
and surer by the generous aid of Mr. Fred L. Homer,
of the Central High School of Pittsburgh, and Mr.
Homer L. Clark, a business man of Cleveland, in reading
a greater portion of the manuscript; by Miss Emily
Beal, of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, in information
on illustrated editions of children's books; and
by Mr. Ernest C. Noyes, of the Peabody High School
of Pittsburgh, in reading the proof.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle2'>THE VALUE OF GOOD BOOKS</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest bring
with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments."</p>

<div class='right'>
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Paul's Letter To Timothy.</span><br />
</div><br /></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> man who believes that education and books
are designed for the imparting only of useful information
had better read no farther than this sentence; for
if he does, he will be irritated many a time by what he
regards as ideal and foolish and unworthy of a practical
age. But if he believes life to be something more
than meat and the body something more than raiment,
and that he needs his books as well as his
cloak brought into Macedonia, he may with patience
and sympathy follow the guesses herein at the ways
and means by which good books may be brought
into the life of a boy. For in the living out of the
great story of securing shelter and food and raiment,
the boy who has never felt the charm of a great
book in chimney-corner days, or the man who has
never pored over a "midnight darling" by candlelight,
has missed one of the most refined and harmless
pleasures of life. The very books themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
are refining because they make up the art of literature,
an art that is in its highest sense an expression
and interpretation of life. This art deals with
the beautiful. Its appeal is primarily to the feelings.
Its basis is truth whether actual or hoped
for. It is this very nature of literature itself that
at the start brings up the question whether the investment
put into it is really worth while. How
far has education a right to develop a sense of the
beautiful? What abiding pleasures and tastes, if
any, should the boy of school age seek and cultivate?
Just what equipment for life does a boy need,
anyhow?</p>

<p>These are big questions; they are knotty questions.
They have never been settled because
they cannot be answered in a way satisfactory to
all. They are rather questions of temperament
than of logic. To attempt an investigation into the
claims of literature in a scheme of education, and to
draw from such claims a logical conclusion, is beyond
the ability, knowledge, or inclination of the writer;
only personal impressions will be attempted in the
chapters that follow. And besides, such an investigation,
if it could be made, would be so out of
fashion among schoolmasters at the present time
that it might bring nothing but reproach on the one
attempting it. The very convenient plan is to
assume a certain educational specific as true and
from that assumption to go straight to a favourable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
conclusion. In accordance with this fashion it
seems the easiest way to take the privilege of the
day and without more ado assume that books
of literature are necessary in the education of a
boy, and conclude therefrom that a principal business
of the teacher is to train the boy to read books
intelligently and to form a substantial taste for
them. And why should not a schoolmaster who
dotes on a few old favourites have an unshaken faith
in his assumption and go merrily on to the business
of the literature itself and what may be done toward
developing among school children a taste for it?</p>

<p>The late Professor Norton pointed out that a
taste for literature is a result of cultivation more
often than a gift of nature. The years of the elementary
school seem to be the time in which cultivation
is easiest and the one in which the taste takes
deepest root. Vigorous and tactful effort will go
far to develop pure taste and abiding taste for
books.</p>

<p>The present age is more concerned about pure food
than about pure books&mdash;maybe an exemplification
of John Bright's wish that the working-men of England
eat bacon rather than read Bacon. The bulky,
coarse food of the last century has been displaced
by the sealed package of condensed food done
according to a formula, and a mystery to the man
who eats it. So is it in our books. We do not have
the frankness and vulgarity of the eighteenth century;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
but instead, we have the most studied forms
of insinuation, the harm of which was not approached
by the coarseness of former times. Many a present-day
story makes the ordinary course of life seem
uninteresting, a dangerous thing for a book to do,
according to Ruskin. The conduct portrayed has in
it too much of personal freedom arising out of
caprice, breaking too much with traditional right
through what a critic once designated as "debauching
innuendo and ill favoured love." The book is
often spectacular or sullen in tone. It may be
melodramatic, leaving the reader rebellious or with
a weakened sense of responsibility. Or again, it
may be given to boisterous laughter over situations
based on personal misfortune or bad manners&mdash;the
way of the comic supplement. And worst of all,
it may become the fashion; that is, a best seller.
Its name and some of its motives will probably get
to the children through the talk of the parents.
Then to persuade the reading public that the pure
taste for the healthful story is much more worth
while will try the resources of the teacher. Yet that
is exactly what should be expected of him&mdash;a Herculean
task and a most thankless one.</p>

<p>To secure a stable as well as a pure taste for things
worth while in books should be an aim of the teacher.
He must do this in an age when the vaudeville idea
is deep-rooted. Variety takes the place of sustained
attention. This begets the mood for profligacy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Something new and good is expected to turn up in
the shape of a book. In this mood there is nothing
to inspire to steady purpose. And it seems that the
best thing left for the teacher to do is to "come out
strong" on a few good books. Through fortune and
misfortune such books will be permanent possessions
to their reader.</p>

<p>The responsibility for securing this pure and abiding
taste rests primarily with the teacher. He needs
to know and to appreciate the good books which
he desires the boy to read. He needs to know the
poem or story at first hand, not criticism about it.
If the teacher has real appreciation for a piece of
literature, the boy will discern it in his face. Then
the boy can be put on the right scent and left to
trail it out for himself, as Scott long ago suggested.
Time must be taken to do this: a few good things
must be done without fuss or hurry. It is foolish to
have a taste surfeited as soon as cultivated. Here is
truly a place to be temperate as well as enthusiastic.</p>

<p>A teacher should be able to read aloud from a
book with good effect. The voice can bring out the
finer touches that are likely to be missed by the
eye. No explanation in reading is so good as is
adequate vocal expression. In fact, as a rule, the
less explaining the better. If there is a single thing
that for the last dozen years has stood in the way
of boys' and girls' appreciating good literature, it is
the so-called laboratory method. Of all the quack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
educational specifics that have been advanced, the
laboratory method, with a poem or an imaginative
story, has been the most presumptuous and
absurd. Who cares to treat fancies and fairies according
to formul&aelig;? One might as well apply the
laboratory method to his faith and his hopes in his
religion.</p>

<p>In this struggle to bring good books into the life
of the boy, many opposing forces must be met with
tact and with patience. Censorship of books, like
inspection of foods, may be highly desirable; but by
no means is it efficacious. The worthless book will
continue to obtrude itself at all times and on all occasions.
Then there are the reading habits of the
community, the notions of parents about what the
child should read, and the child's own natural or
acquired tastes,&mdash;these must all be reckoned with.
Here are a few of the opposing forces to be encountered
in every community:</p>

<p>The juvenile series&mdash;the hardest problem to
handle from the book side of the question. The
series is always "awful long," all of the volumes are
cut to the same pattern, they are always in evidence,
and they are all equally stupid. The themes range
from boarding school proprieties to criminal adventure;
and they are all equally false to the facts of
real life or the longings for true romance. What
shall be done with them?</p>

<p>The ease of access of the child to the daily paper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
with headlines inviting attention to the doings of
police courts and clinics.</p>

<p>The eagerness with which children read the comic
supplement and even ask at the public library if
books of that class of humour cannot be had.</p>

<p>The low-grade selection that is many times given
the child by the school reader as subject-matter from
which to learn the great art of reading.</p>

<p>The prejudice of parents and even of communities
against fairy tales and all forms of highly imaginative
literature&mdash;the hardest thing to meet from
the reading side of the question. Librarians are requested
not to give fairy books to children. Such
books are thought to be bad. The demand is for true
books. Parents have not discovered the existence
of the imagination and the part it has played in the
intellectual, artistic, and spiritual progress of man.
But must school teachers not first recognize the
truth of this last statement before parents are expected
to do so?</p>

<p>The impression that books of information are
real literature and that they ought to be sufficient
subject-matter for any child's reading.</p>

<p>The belief that books should teach facts and point
morals rather than entertain and refine and inspire.</p>

<p>The early acquired taste of boys and girls for
stories of everyday life; boys turning to the athletic
story and girls to the school story.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Excessive reading and reading done at the suggestion
of a chum.</p>

<p>Lack of ownership of books and of the rereading
of great books.</p>

<p>The passing of the practice of reading aloud about
the fireside.</p>

<p>The teacher will surely need to summon his judgment,
courage, and perseverance if he is to succeed
measurably in the effort for good reading. Let him
not forget that his most enduring work will not be
seeking to cut off from the child the book that
is not good, nor yet convincing the parents that
this or that book is good or bad; but it will be
getting the interest and confidence of the child
himself. When the teacher comes to consider that
a boy naturally loves a hero, and like Tom Sawyer
longs to "die temporarily," or that a girl is naturally
curious to open the forbidden door of the closet as
was Fatima, he cannot but see that this is good
ground where the right seed will spring up many
fold. Here then is the place for the teacher to sow
with care. For him, the pages that follow are
designed as something of a guide in the field of children's
books, if, whilst working as a husbandman
therein, by chance he feels the need of a fellow
labourer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> place of literature in the primary and grammar
grades of schools needs neither a defence nor an
apology. Being a part of that branch called reading,
it is fundamental in the course. The claims set up
by branches other than that of reading and speaking
English do not concern us here. We assume that
the first portion of time in a programme is allotted
to this. The object may be dramatic expression in
the lower grades, getting the exact thought from a
printed page and reproducing it in the upper grades,
drill in the mechanical details of the language,
such as spelling and pronunciation; or it may be
that rare growth of personality that comes, say,
through the skilful reading of poetry aloud. Without
a fair degree of mastery of the elements of
reading and speaking English by the time he completes
the grammar grade work, the boy will enter
a secondary school or turn to earning a living, ill-equipped
either to organize and express his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
thoughts, or to find profit and pleasure in gathering
the thoughts of another from a printed page&mdash;the
greatest accomplishment that a school can give to
any one. It is rather common to hear a high school
student say that he cannot get the story by reading
"The Lady of the Lake." This inability is a positive
discredit to what should be normal mental vigour;
and such a student will be found inefficient for the
serious business of life or the refined pleasure of the
fireside.</p>

<p>Now it behooves teachers to put on their thinking
caps and devise ways and means that will help
students to get the thought from reading, to tell
this thought, and to appreciate the excellencies of
good English books. And they must do this single-handed
and alone in the day school, for but little
help can be looked for from the Sunday school, from
many public libraries, and from the home as it is
now governed. The child is turned over to the
teacher to train, and in that child lurk two tendencies
of American social life: the hope of getting something
for nothing and the passion for constant
variety. And these tendencies are unchecked by
any exercise of that old-time positive authority in
the home, that had much salutary influence on young
barbarians. But through a foolish tolerance, the
boy drifts into many habits that do not include the
exemplary ones of sustained attention, industry,
thrift, and self-reliance,&mdash;habits that make for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
efficient life. A royal road to knowledge is expected,
and travel thereon is to be unrestricted by
respect either for age or for authority. His hay
must always be sugared. He becomes a creature of
whims, and with this creature the teacher finds his
task in hand. What are the reading habits and
tastes that he brings from his home, and how can
the teacher best improve them?</p>

<p>It is clear to even a casual observer that children
leave the public school without the groundwork for
a course of reading either for pleasure or for profit
through life. It is also clear that they will get little
help in this line from places other than the public
school as things now obtain. And it is equally clear
that the reading habits formed before the age of
fourteen years are the habits and tastes that last.
If then, according to his natural gifts, the student
is to be led to gather the fullest measure from the
field of literature, it is the special duty and privilege
of the teacher to direct that gathering. To this
attempt to develop a taste for good literature, some
one may raise the objection that it will not fit all
children&mdash;and the objection is well taken. The
appeal of literature is not universal. There are a
few persons who find its counterpart in a study and
appreciation of the beauties and wonders of nature.
Then again there are many who, instead of taking
themselves to the art of books, find pleasure in perhaps
the greatest of all arts, the art of social intercourse&mdash;an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
art that is universal enough to reach from
vagabondia to the very exclusive set. However,
there is a vast class devoted to a subdued and
refined domestic life, and here it is that good books
will bear good fruit many fold. With this class the
teacher must work. What then is to be given to
the children?</p>

<p>Of course it is understood that we are to deal with
the enduring literature of childhood, the literature
of power. And it is also to be understood that reading
is to be done in moderation and with care. Then
again it is evident that a certain amount of reading
must be prescribed and thoroughly mastered.
Reading must be from what is standard down to the
point of appeal, lest the point always hold the boy
to the earth earthy. After a taste for onions has
once been developed, little hope can be entertained
of making the boy a judge of the delicate flavour of
grapes&mdash;they will hang high. The teacher must
assert a bit of that healthful positive authority that
sets many an urchin on the right path. A limited
choice from books that are classics may be given in
good time. All the chords of life have been struck
in great literature, and a fair knowledge and good
judgment can reach almost any disposition, even
the most whimsical.</p>

<p>The thing of first importance to be prescribed is
learning classical poetry by heart until its music has
taken a hold on the learner. Introduce the boy to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the varied field of lyric poetry and you have put
before him one of the rarest and most abiding
pleasures of life. Here his troubled heart may
always find consolation. Nothing will bring him
to a sense of his own personality with such a deft
touch as a perfect lyric coming to him through his
own voice. The next thing to look to is a right
that is a fixed right of childhood and one that it is
positively vicious to suppress, the right to the land
of fairy life. A free range here will be meat and
drink to any boy. Much sordidness and much selfishness
in old age come to the man or woman who
has not a cultivated imagination. Logic and cold
facts are of precious little value in the fireside life
of a family. The best things of that life are not
reasoned out; but they are felt out and wondered
out. Again, the great field of mythology that is so
fundamentally linked to that of literature, and that
is a capital mark of culture, should be open to the
boy that he may roam about and wonder at its
mysteries. Then he may as certainly come to own
an "Age of Fable" as he must own a "Golden
Treasury." And what a pair are these!</p>

<p>From these three fields the step will be to a knowledge
and classification of books and their authors,
what books to own, and how to take care of them.
And to this working grasp of poetry and stories may
be added a little of what is possible in history,
biography, and personal essay. In this age of cheap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and spurious book-making the reader must know
standard editions without abridged and garbled
texts. Even editors of hymn books do not hesitate
to mutilate great hymns to suit their particular
notions. This freedom may be a form of that exaggerated
idea of personal privilege that was the gift
of democracy in the past century. A good knowledge
of fables and proverbial wisdom will certainly temper
that notion. Such are some of the things that might
be prescribed by the teacher and learned by the student.
The field as thus given is limited, but the
friends therein are dear friends. Nor are they to be
exchanged for the new friends that may come
through the advertising appeal, founded on the unsubstantial
instinct for constant variety.</p>

<p>If enough idea of authority can ever be driven into
the head of the American boy to put him into the
attitude of a willing learner, good things may be
looked for in habits of reading&mdash;provided the
teacher be equal to the responsible task that is laid
upon him. The habits of reading that measure the
use of spare time, and in that way the character
of the individual, will work for a more sane and less
showy home life and through that for a community
given to other than obtrusive and frivolous social
life. What bundle of habits will serve its slave
better than will this bundle? Or where is keener
and more subdued pleasure to be found? Though
books are a bloodless substitute for life, as Stevenson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
has well pointed out, we need some substitute in our
hours of ease, and a good book does passing well for
such a substitute; and this is especially true if the
book be our favourite from the wonderful Waverley
series and with it we can square about to the fire,
snuff the candle, and let the rest of the world go spin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle2'>THE LEARNING OF LYRIC POETRY</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"These verses be worthy to keep a room in every man's memory: they
be choicely good."</p>

<div class='right'>
&mdash;From "The Complete Angler."<br />
</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> teacher who is a workman skilled in his craft
looks upon a few educational practices as being of
intrinsic merit&mdash;through and through in an age of
veneer and cheap imitation. Of these practices the
one most fruitful under cultivation, when done with
care and in moderation, is that of learning good
poetry by heart. The sense of having truly learned
a thing by heart, of having completely mastered it,
is a most pleasant sense to have. And when the
thing learned is one of the many perfect lyrics from
the field of English poetry, a far-sighted judge who
has lived and considered what is of most value to the
individual is led to say: That is well and good. In
some mysterious way this possession of a few choice
poems makes for a rarer personality and gives that
touch which can come only through a perfect work
of art. By sheer force of intellect a man may become
a cold, designing man of action and set plans
on foot for the time being; but the power that is
back of all great movements for civilization and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
culture is one that is grounded in feeling and constructive
imagination. The proverbial songs of a
nation are a greater force than are its laws. In one
of his most entertaining essays, De Quincey points
out that, when the intellect sets itself up in opposition
to the feelings, one should always trust to the
feelings. Normal instincts are worth more than syllogisms.
The man who has attuned himself to the
moods and impulses of lyric poetry is a safe man in
action. Yet he is more than this; he has in him
that which is the groundwork of fireside pleasures
and of the joys of companionship. In other words,
he is a man of cultivated imagination, and he can
play in many moods.</p>

<p>Here it may not be amiss to mention the claim
of the imagination to consideration as a faculty of
the mind and inquire to what extent it should be
cultivated in our schools; for if its claim be not
good, there is no warrant for using any of the literature
of power as subject-matter for education.
Bearing on this question is the following excellent remark
by the late Charles Eliot Norton, who did so
very much to raise the standard of culture in American
education: "The imagination is the supreme intellectual
faculty, and it is of all the one that receives
least attention in our common system of education.
The reason is not far to seek. The imagination is
of all faculties the most difficult to control, it is the
most elusive of all, the rarest in its full power. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
upon its healthy development depend not only the
sound exercise of the faculties of observation and
judgment, but also the command of the reason, the
control of the will, and the growth of the moral
sympathies. The means for its culture which good
reading affords is the most generally available and
one of the most efficient." In the same discussion
Professor Norton has this to say of poetry as the
highest expression of the imagination: "Poetry is
one of the most efficient means of education of the
moral sentiment, as well as of the intelligence. It is
the source of the best culture. A man may know
all science and yet remain uneducated. But let
him truly possess himself of the work of any one of
the great poets, and no matter what else he may fail
to know, he is not without education."</p>

<p>To the evident truth of these quotations the humanist
will readily assent; and so will the true
scientist whose earnest and frank devotion to truth
makes it clear to him that nothing great in his field
has ever been done without a constructive imagination.
The loss of artistic imagination through
years of painstaking investigation will be a source of
regret to any one devoted to science, as was the
loss of the ability to appreciate the charm of great
poetry Darwin's old age regret. The taste for this
great poetry is grounded on healthful and normal
instincts, and it is the part of wisdom to see that this
taste be developed in youth. The boy who has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
nurtured his youthful imagination on the magic of
great verse will waken up some morning to find himself
among the competent ones of his generation.
His life will be bounded by that restraint which can
come only through an inability to solve the mysteries
and wonders that his imagination is constantly conjuring
up. He wants much that he cannot understand
and reason out; and the deeper things of life,
things which touch him most vitally as a living creature,
he looks on with reverence. If his imagination
is alive to the experiences of great poetry, he
cannot scoff at things felt in the soul but impossible
of explanation. To him there are sacred things in
the fireside life and at the altar that are not to be
laid bare by the curiosity of the reasoner in his search
for truth. And when the twilight of the gods falls
about him he is not curious to know, but he trusts
and fears. A song is worth more to him than a
proof. On this he is satisfied to throw himself.</p>

<p>The music of the cathedral organ that Milton
could hear daily as a boy stirred his imagination, and
in later years he brought forth verse that for the
grandeur and scope of its imagination has never
been excelled. In a minor but far more human key
the songs and balladry of Scotland awakened in
Burns the imagination which has made him the idol
of his native land and loved wherever English
poetry is known. Artistic imagination for the creation
or appreciation of poetry is contagious. What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
is true of the poet himself is also true of the reader of
great poetry; its wonderful music causes him to
feel and live poems that he has not the gift to write
down. It is with this feeling of poems, this appreciation
of the great work of poets, that we have to do.
To awaken feelings a teacher must have an imagination
afire with a little verse that is choicely good, must
have at least felt the pure serene a time or two. This
same passion for verse, be it ever so limited, can be
handed over to the boy through a judicious use of
the reading voice. That is the teacher's work in
hand.</p>

<p>What kind of verse is to be handed over to the boy,
and how much is there to be of it? To the latter
question the only safe answer is this: not too much.
Talents and tastes vary. Every student can be
made to get by rote a certain amount of verse;
but as for learning it by heart, feeling and appreciating
its music, that is a different thing. The greatest
and most painstaking of all anthologists of English
verse, Francis Turner Palgrave, claims that there
ought to be more than a glimpse into the Elysian
fields of song. In the best collection that has yet
appeared for the teacher or student, "The Children's
Treasury of English Song," Professor Palgrave
has this to say in the introduction: "The treasures
here collected are but a few drops from an
ocean, unequalled in wealth and variety by any existing
literature. But the hope is held that it may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
prove a pleasure and gain to the dear English and
English-speaking children, all the world over,&mdash;yet
the editor will hold his work but half fulfilled,
unless they are tempted by it to go on and wander,
in whatever direction their fancy may lead them,
through the roads and winding ways of this great
and glorious world of English poetry. He aims only
at showing them the path, and giving them a little
foretaste of our treasures.&mdash;'To-morrow to fresh
woods and pastures new.'" That hope is to be the
hope of the teacher; and it needs back of it the
mastering of a few choice lyrics, after which the boy
is to be sent forth to browse alone to his heart's
desire.</p>

<p>On the question of the kind of verse to give to the
boy, Professor Palgrave has made the following
remark: "The standard of 'suitability to childhood'
must exclude many pieces that have 'merit as
poetry': pictures of life as it seems to middle age&mdash;poems
coloured by sentimentalism or morbid melancholy,
however attractive to readers no longer children&mdash;love
as personal passion or regret (not love
as the groundwork of action)&mdash;artificial or highly
allusive language&mdash;have, as a rule, been held unfit.
The aim has been to shun scenes and sentiments
alien from the temper of average healthy childhood,
and hence of greater intrinsic difficulty than poems
containing unusual words." The limitations of
verse for children, as stated in the remark just quoted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
are reasonable and something of a guide to teachers.
But they are not always easy to follow. However,
nothing must be given to the child unless it has real
merit as poetry, no matter how it may strike the
fancy at first reading. Nor is any poem that would
be otherwise good, to be excluded because it is feared
the child may not completely grasp it. He may read
plenty of verse that is beyond him somewhat and
be all the better for having done so. The thing to
be avoided is poetry that is not poetry. He may be
allowed to read verse at times that would not be
suitable for learning by heart. But what he learns
thoroughly must be through and through great
poetry. And it matters little what form it may
have: ballad, song, fairy poem&mdash;he will learn
to know it and to love it. Nor is it to be always
within the reach of his intellect; his feelings will
carry him safely beyond the narrow range of understanding.</p>

<p>If he would reach the boy, the teacher must find
a point of contact between the home life and the
altogether new life in the school. This point is
without doubt the nursery rhymes. Wise indeed
are parents who have taught these melodies before
the school age has been reached, for the teacher can
start at once with the poems he intends to have
learned. But where these rhymes have not been
mastered in the home, it is imperative on the part
of the first-grade teacher to have them mastered in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the first school year. For the teacher who hesitates
about the advisability of using the Mother Goose
melodies, it may be well to state their claim by a
quotation from Charles Welsh in his modest but
most excellent collection called "A Book of Nursery
Rhymes": "The direct simplicity, dramatic imagination,
and spontaneous humour of the nursery
rhymes of Mother Goose will probably never be excelled
by any modern verse. They will for the most
part doubtless remain for all time 'the light literature
of the infant scholar.' Although some fragments
of what has been written since the collection was
first made may go to swell the volume of this inheritance
from past ages, the selection of any permanent
addition will be made finally by the mother
and the child. The choice will be by no means a
haphazard one, for it will be founded on basal elements
of human character, and it will, for the very
same cause, be an absolutely autocratic choice.
Experience has proved these old rhymes and jingles
to be best fitted for the awakening intelligence
of the child. The appeal to the imagination by
evoking a sense of wonder accounts for the abiding
place which these rhymes and jingles have in the
literature of the nursery." The truth of these words
is so evident that the teacher who would make the
learning of poetry by heart a pleasure must surely recognize
such rhymes as the hitching-on place between
the literature of the home and that of the school.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Next in simplicity, directness, and in the interest
of its appeal is verse in the ballad form. It is the
easiest of all poetry to learn, for it tells a dramatic
tale in a simple way. But there are few short ballads
in the language suited to the grammar grades, and
there is not sufficient time for learning the longer
ones by heart. Many of the best old English ballads
have difficulties for the child in the number
of obsolete words that they contain. These two
things make it difficult to use this absorbing field of
poetry as subject-matter for learning by heart. It
is probably best to have the boy come to know the
stories of the ballads by hearing a frequent reading
of them aloud by the teacher. Of the ballads
selected for such reading the teacher must go to the
old English field to get the greater number; but the
modern field must not be neglected, for no teacher
could omit that powerful yet simple work of genius,
"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner." Its charm in
holding the hearer is as great as was the charm of the
old mariner's eye itself when telling the tale. If such
a poem has been listened to in the elementary school,
it can be taught with greater ease in the secondary
school. The same thing is true of many poems.</p>

<p>The greater number of selections that follow these
two simple and direct types, the nursery rhyme and
the ballad, must be classic lyrics, fairly well suited
to the boy, and it matters little whether the form be
song, sonnet, ode, elegy, or that of Hebrew verse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
In making these selections poems of a martial
nature are not to be altogether neglected; but they
must have fire, for without it a war ode is one of the
most obsolete works of the human intellect. An
objection may be raised to the effect that this type
of poem is not suited to girls. To this objection the
answer may be made, that what is good literature
for a boy ought to be good literature for a girl. Will
not a girl appreciate that great poem of a sea fight,
"The 'Revenge'"? It seems unwise to put in a list
of poems to be learned by heart an example of nonsense
verse. This verse evidently has a definite place
in the intellectual equipment of the child, and he
may pick it up later of his own accord. No one
would knowingly, however, deprive him of "The Owl
and the Pussy Cat," or "The Jabberwocky"; even
grown-ups dote on "Little Billee," as Thackeray
doubtless did himself. We must all fool more or
less&mdash;even in verse.</p>

<p>Some teachers will ask how poetry is to be taught.
To that question the absolute answer is: through
the ear. All poetry is to be read aloud and well
read. The dry-as-dust fellow who wants to read it
merely as prose should be indicted for a crime against
art. Poetry must be read musically and with a
natural time and swing. At this point it should be
understood that part of the work of a teacher is to
develop a good reading tone of voice. The present-day
tendencies toward shrieking and a mouthing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of words are most deplorable tendencies. Let the
teacher first master the poem and then teach it by
word of mouth, and teach it as music. It will finally
impress itself on the child. Now this reading by
which the poem is to be taught is to be merely a good
natural reading&mdash;not the affected and exaggerated
one of the elocutionist. Let the child get the idea
that he must say the poem over and over until it
has become his own. There is much pleasure in
saying poetry aloud when one is walking by himself&mdash;a
rare luxury in modern city or suburban life.
It does not matter if passers-by look on this practice
as a sort of lunacy, for it is a most commendable
kind of lunacy to have and one that all persons are
not so lucky as to possess.</p>

<p>So much is inviting us that no claim is made that
the included list is by any means the best one hundred
poems. But it is one that the experience of some
years of schoolroom work has proved passing good.
At least it is good enough for the teacher who has
not made a thorough study of the subject. This,
that, and t'other substitute might be offered; but
when all is said, the selections as they stand, if well
mastered, will be something of a king's treasury to
the boy.</p>

<p>For the convenience of the teacher the selections
are given complete. With but few exceptions the
poems are unabridged and under the original titles.
When an extract has been made from a longer poem,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the first verse of the selection has generally been
given as a title. All poems might be remembered
by first verses rather than by titles, and every
anthology should have an alphabetical index to first
verses. The poems as given below will vary in their
appeal largely according to the mood of the teacher
and his natural temperament; but he can teach
no poem well unless he has mastered it himself and
has come to appreciate it. There are a few selections,
however, as "The Fairy Life," "The Forsaken
Merman," and "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud,"
that are so wholly delightful that the teacher may
hold them as favourite children of the imagination.
Let the teacher master the selections given below,
and if he so choose tear out the pages containing
them and then throw the rest of the book away;
for if he truly knows these poems by heart, he will
no longer be a stranger to literature of power, and the
purpose of this book will have been fulfilled.</p>

Little Bo-peep has lost her sheep,<br />

Leave them alone and they'll come home,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bring their tails behind them.</span><br />
<br />
Little Bo-peep fell fast asleep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And dreamt she heard them bleating;</span><br />
But when she awoke she found it a joke,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">For still they all were fleeting.</span><br />
<br />
Then up she took her little crook,<br />

She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For they'd left all their tails behind 'em.</span><br />

The four-and-twenty sailors<br />

Were four-and-twenty white mice,<br />

The captain was a duck,<br />

With different uniforms and drills,<br />
Among the bed-clothes through the hills;<br />
<br />
And sometimes sent my ships in fleets<br />
All up and down among the sheets;<br />
<br />
Or brought my trees and houses out,<br />
And planted cities all about.<br />

I was the giant great and still<br />
That sits upon the pillow-hill,<br />

And sees before him, dale and plain,<br />

I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,<br />
And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.<br />
He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;<br />
And I see him jump before me when I jump into my bed.<br />
<br />
The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow&mdash;<br />
Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;<br />
For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,<br />
And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.<br />
<br />
He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,<br />
And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.<br />
He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see;<br />
I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me.<br />
<br />
One morning, very early, before the sun was up,<br />
I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;<br />
But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,<br />
Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.<br />

That he sings, and he sings; and forever sings he&mdash;<br />

Whene'er you are happy and cannot tell why,<br />
The Friend of the Children is sure to be by!<br />
<br />
He loves to be little, he hates to be big,<br />
'Tis he that inhabits the caves that you dig;<br />
'Tis he when you play with your soldiers of tin<br />
That sides with the Frenchmen and never can win.<br />
<br />
'Tis he, when at night you go off to your bed,<br />
Bids you go to your sleep and not trouble your head;<br />
For wherever they're lying, in cupboard or shelf,<br />
'Tis he will take care of your playthings himself!<br />

But keep the wolf far thence, that's foe to men:<br />

<div class='poem'>
My heart leaps up when I behold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A rainbow in the sky:</span><br />
So was it when my life began,<br />
So is it now I am a man,<br />
So be it when I shall grow old<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or let me die!</span><br />
The Child is father of the Man:<br />
And I could wish my days to be<br />
Bound each to each by natural piety.<br />

Pack, clouds, away, and welcome day:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With night we banish sorrow;</span><br />
Sweet air blow soft, mount larks aloft,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To give my Love good-morrow!</span><br />
Wings from the wind to please her mind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Notes from the lark I'll borrow;</span><br />
Bird, prune thy wing, nightingale, sing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To give my Love good-morrow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To give my Love good-morrow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Notes from them both I'll borrow.</span><br />
<br />
Wake from thy nest, Robin-red-breast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sing, birds, in every furrow;</span><br />
And from each hill, let music shrill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Give my fair Love good-morrow!</span><br />
Blackbird and thrush in every bush,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Stare, linnet, and cock-sparrow!</span><br />
You pretty elves, amongst yourselves,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sing my fair Love good-morrow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To give my Love good-morrow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Sing, birds, in every furrow!</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Through the surf and through the swell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The far-off sound of a silver bell?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sand-strewn caverns, cool and deep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where the winds are all asleep;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where the spent lights quiver and gleam;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where the salt weed sways in the stream;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where the sea-beasts, ranged all round,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Feed in the ooze of their pasture-ground;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where the sea-snakes coil and twine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dry their mail, and bask in the brine;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where great whales come sailing by,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sail and sail, with unshut eye,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Round the world for ever and aye?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When did music come this way?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Children dear, was it yesterday?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Children dear, was it yesterday</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(Call yet once) that she went away?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Once she sate with you and me.</span><br />
On a red gold throne in the heart of the sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the youngest sate on her knee.</span><br />
She comb'd its bright hair, and she tended it well,<br />
When down swung the sound of the far-off bell.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>She sigh'd, she look'd up through the clear green sea.<br />
She said, "I must go, for my kinsfolk pray<br />
In the little gray church on the shore to-day.<br />
'Twill be Easter-time in the world&mdash;ah me!<br />
And I lose my poor soul, Merman, here with thee."<br />
I said, "Go up, dear heart, through the waves.<br />
Say thy prayer, and come back to the kind sea-caves."<br />
She smiled, she went up through the surf in the bay.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Children dear, was it yesterday?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Children dear, were we long alone?</span><br />
"The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan.<br />
Long prayers," I said, "in the world they say.<br />
Come," I said, and we rose through the surf in the bay.<br />
We went up the beach, by the sandy down<br />
Where the sea-stocks bloom, to the white-wall'd town,<br />
Through the narrow paved streets, where all was still,<br />
To the little gray church on the windy hill.<br />
From the church came a murmur of folk at their prayers,<br />
But we stood without in the cold-blowing airs.<br />
We climb'd on the graves, on the stones worn with rains,<br />
And we gazed up the aisle through the small leaded panes.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She sate by the pillar; we saw her clear:</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Margaret, hist! come quick, we are here.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dear heart," I said, "we are long alone.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The sea grows stormy, the little ones moan."</span><br />
But, ah! she gave me never a look,<br />
For her eyes were seal'd to the holy book.<br />
Loud prays the priest; shut stands the door.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Come away, children, call no more.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Come away, come down, call no more.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Down, down, down;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Down to the depths of the sea.</span><br />
She sits at her wheel in the humming town,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Singing most joyfully.</span><br />
Hark what she sings: "O joy, O joy,<br />
For the humming street, and the child with its toy;<br />
For the priest, and the bell, and the holy well;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For the wheel where I spun,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the bless&egrave;d light of the sun."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And so she sings her fill,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Singing most joyfully,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Till the shuttle falls from her hand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the whizzing wheel stands still.</span><br />
She steals to the window, and looks at the sand;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And over the sand at the sea;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And her eyes are set in a stare;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And anon there breaks a sigh,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And anon there drops a tear,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">From a sorrow-clouded eye,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And a heart sorrow-laden,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">A long, long sigh</span><br />
For the cold strange eyes of a little Mermaiden,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the gleam of her golden hair.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Come away, away, children.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Come, children, come down.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The hoarse wind blows colder;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lights shine in the town.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She will start from her slumber</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When gusts shake the door;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She will hear the winds howling,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Will hear the waves roar.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We shall see, while above us</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The waves roar and whirl,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A ceiling of amber,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A pavement of pearl.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Singing, "Here came a mortal,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But faithless was she:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And alone dwell for ever</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The kings of the sea."</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But, children, at midnight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When soft the winds blow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When clear falls the moonlight;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When spring-tides are low:</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">When sweet airs come seaward</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From heaths starr'd with broom;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And high rocks throw mildly</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On the blanch'd sands a gloom:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Up the still, glistening beaches,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Up the creeks we will hie;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Over banks of bright seaweed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The ebb-tide leaves dry.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We will gaze, from the sand-hills,</span><br />

<h3><span class="smcap">The Brook</span></h3>

<div class='poem'>
I come from haunts of coot and hern,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I make a sudden sally,</span><br />
And sparkle out among the fern,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To bicker down a valley.</span><br />
<br />
By thirty hills I hurry down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or slip between the ridges,</span><br />
By twenty thorps, a little town,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And half a hundred bridges.</span><br />
<br />
Till last by Philip's farm I flow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To join the brimming river,</span><br />
For men may come and men may go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But I go on forever.</span><br />
<br />
I chatter over stony ways,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In little sharps and trebles,</span><br />
I bubble into eddying bays,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I babble on the pebbles.</span><br />
<br />
With many a curve my banks I fret<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By many a field and fallow,</span><br />
And many a fairy foreland set<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">With willow-weed and mallow.</span><br />
<br />
I chatter, chatter, as I flow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To join the brimming river,</span><br />
For men may come and men may go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But I go on forever.</span><br />
<br />
I wind about, and in and out,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With here a blossom sailing,</span><br />
And here and there a lusty trout,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And here and there a grayling,</span><br />
<br />
And here and there a foamy flake<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Upon me, as I travel</span><br />
With many a silvery waterbreak<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Above the golden gravel,</span><br />
<br />
And draw them all along, and flow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To join the brimming river,</span><br />
For men may come and men may go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But I go on forever.</span><br />
<br />
I steal by lawns and grassy plots,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I slide by hazel covers;</span><br />
I move the sweet forget-me-nots<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That grow for happy lovers.</span><br />
<br />
I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Among my skimming swallows;</span><br />
I make the netted sunbeam dance<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Against my sandy shallows.</span><br />
<br />
I murmur under moon and stars<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In brambly wildernesses;</span><br />
I linger by my shingly bars;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I loiter round my cresses;</span><br />
<br />
And out again I curve and flow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To join the brimming river,</span><br />
For men may come and men may go.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But I go on forever.</span><br />

<h3><span class="smcap">The Burning Babe</span></h3>

<div class='poem2'>
As I in hoary winter's night stood shivering in the snow,<br />
Surprised I was with sudden heat, which made my heart to glow;<br />
And lifting up a fearful eye to view what fire was near,<br />
A pretty babe, all burning bright, did in the air appear;<br />
Who, scorch&egrave;d with excessive heat, such floods of tears did shed,<br />
As though his floods should quench his flames which with his tears were fed:&mdash;<br />
"Alas!" quoth He, "but newly born, in fiery heats I fry,<br />
Yet none approach to warm their hearts or feel my fire but I!<br />
<br />
"My faultless breast the furnace is, the fuel wounding thorns;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>Love is the fire, and sighs the smoke, the ashes shame and scorns;<br />
The fuel Justice layeth on, and Mercy blows the coals,<br />
The metal in this furnace wrought are men's defil&egrave;d souls,<br />
For which, as now on fire I am, to work them to their good,<br />
So will I melt into a bath to wash them in my blood."&mdash;<br />
With this He vanished out of sight, and swiftly shrunk away;<br />
And straight I call&egrave;d unto mind that it was Christmas-day.<br />

A wet sheet and a flowing sea,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And bends the gallant mast;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Old England on the lee.</span><br />
<br />
O for a soft and gentle wind!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">I heard a fair one cry;</span><br />
But give to me the snoring breeze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And white waves heaving high;</span><br />
And white waves heaving high, my lads,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The good ship tight and free:&mdash;</span><br />
The world of waters is our home,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And merry men are we.</span><br />
<br />
There's tempest in yon horn&egrave;d moon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And lightning in yon cloud;</span><br />
But hark the music, mariners!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The wind is piping loud;</span><br />
The wind is piping loud, my boys,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The lightning flashes free&mdash;</span><br />
While the hollow oak our palace is,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our heritage the sea.</span><br />

Where lies the land to which the ship would go?<br />
Far, far ahead, is all her seamen know.<br />

Linked arm in arm, how pleasant here to pace;<br />
Or, o'er the stern reclining, watch below<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>The foaming wake far widening as we go.<br />
<br />
On stormy nights when wild north-westers rave,<br />

The dripping sailor on the reeling mast<br />
Exults to bear, and scorns to wish it past.<br />
<br />
Where lies the land to which the ship would go?<br />

<h3><span class="smcap">Robin Goodfellow</span></h3>

<div class='poem'>
From Oberon, in fairy land,<br />
The king of ghosts and shadows there,<br />
Mad Robin I, at his command,<br />
Am sent to view the night-sports here.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">What revel rout</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Is kept about,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In every corner where I go,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">I will o'ersee,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And merry be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And make good sport, with ho, ho, ho!</span><br />
<br />
More swift than lightning can I fly<br />
About this airy welkin soon,<br />
And, in a minute's space, descry<br />
Each thing that's done below the moon.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">There's not a hag</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Or ghost shall wag,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or cry 'ware goblins, where I go;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">But, Robin, I</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Their feast will spy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And send them home with ho, ho, ho!</span><br />
<br />
Whene'er such wanderers I meet,<br />
As from their night-sports they trudge home,<br />
With counterfeiting voice I greet,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>And call them on with me to roam;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Through woods, through lakes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Through bogs, through brakes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or else, unseen, with them I go,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">All in the nick</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">To play some trick,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And frolic it, with ho, ho, ho!</span><br />
<br />
Sometimes I meet them like a man,<br />
Sometimes an ox, sometimes a hound;<br />
And to a horse I turn me can,<br />
To trip and trot about them round.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">But if to ride,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">My back they stride,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More swift than wind away I go,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">O'er hedge and lands.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Through pools and ponds,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I hurry, laughing, ho, ho, ho!</span><br />
<br />
By wells and rills, in meadows green,<br />
We nightly dance our heyday guise;<br />
And to our fairy King and Queen,<br />
We chant our moonlight minstrelsies.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">When larks 'gin sing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Away we fling;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And babes new born steal as we go;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And elf in bed,</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wend us laughing, ho, ho, ho!</span><br />
<br />
From hag-bred Merlin's time have I<br />
Thus nightly revell'd to and fro;<br />
And for my pranks men call me by<br />
The name of Robin Good-fellow.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Fiends, ghosts, and sprites,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Who haunt the nights,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hags and goblins do me know;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And beldames old</span><br />

The heavens declare the glory of God;<br />
And the firmament showeth his handiwork.<br />
Day unto day uttereth speech,<br />
And night unto night sheweth knowledge.<br />
There is no speech nor language,<br />
Where their voice is not heard.<br />
Their line is gone out through all the earth,<br />
And their words to the end of the world.<br />
<br />
In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,<br />
Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,<br />
And rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.<br />
His going forth is from the end of the heaven,<br />
And his circuit unto the ends of it:<br />
And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.<br />
<br />
The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul:<br />

The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.<br />
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:<br />
Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.<br />

Moreover by them is thy servant warned:<br />
And in keeping of them there is great reward.<br />
Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.<br />
Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have<br /><span style="margin-left: 6em;">dominion over me:</span><br />
Then shall I be upright,<br />
And I shall be innocent from the great transgression.<br />

Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight,<br />

<h3><span class="smcap">The Death of the Flowers</span></h3>

<div class='poem2'>
The melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year,<br />
Of wailing winds, and naked woods, and meadows brown and sear.<br />
Heap'd in the hollows of the grove, the autumn leaves lie dead;<br />
They rustle to the eddying gust, and to the rabbit's tread.<br />
The robin and the wren are flown, and from the shrubs the jay,<br />
And from the wood-top calls the crow through all the gloomy day.<br />
<br />
The wind-flower and the violet, they perish'd long ago,<br />
And the brier-rose and the orchid died amid the summer glow;<br />
But on the hill the golden-rod, and the aster in the wood,<br />
And the yellow sun-flower by the brook in autumn beauty stood,<br />
Till fell the frost from the clear cold heaven, as falls the plague on men,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>And the brightness of their smile was gone, from upland, glade, and glen.<br />
<br />
And now, when comes the calm mild day, as still such days will come,<br />
To call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter home;<br />
When the sound of dropping nuts is heard, though all the trees are still,<br />
And twinkle in the smoky light the waters of the rill,<br />
The south wind searches for the flowers whose fragrance late he bore,<br />
And sighs to find them in the wood and by the stream no more.<br />

And the skipper had taken his little daughter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To bear him company.</span><br />
<br />
Blue were her eyes as the fairy flax,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Her cheeks like the dawn of day,</span><br />
And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That ope in the month of May.</span><br />
<br />
The skipper he stood beside the helm,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">His pipe was in his mouth;</span><br />
And he watched how the veering flaw did blow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The smoke now West, now South.</span><br />
<br />
Then up and spake an old Sail&ograve;r,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Had sailed the Spanish Main:</span><br />
"I pray thee, put into yonder port,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For I fear a hurricane.</span><br />
<br />
"Last night, the moon had a golden ring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And to-night no moon we see!"</span><br />
The skipper, he blew a whiff from his pipe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And a scornful laugh laughed he.</span><br />
<br />
Colder and louder blew the wind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A gale from the North-east;</span><br />
The snow fell hissing in the brine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the billows frothed like yeast.</span><br />
<br />
Down came the storm, and smote amain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The vessel in its strength;</span><br />
She shuddered and paused, like a frightened steed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then leaped her cable's length.</span><br />
<br />
"Come hither! come hither! my little daughter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And do not tremble so;</span><br />
For I can weather the roughest gale,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">That ever wind did blow."</span><br />
<br />
He wrapped her warm in his seaman's coat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Against the stinging blast;</span><br />
He cut a rope from a broken spar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And bound her to a mast.</span><br />
<br />
"O father! I hear the church bells ring.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O say, what may it be?"</span><br />
"'Tis a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast!"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And he steered for the open sea.</span><br />
<br />
"O father! I hear the sound of guns,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O say, what may it be?"</span><br />
"Some ship in distress, that cannot live<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In such an angry sea!"</span><br />
<br />
"O father! I see a gleaming light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O say, what may it be?"</span><br />
But the father answered never a word,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A frozen corpse was he.</span><br />
<br />
Lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With his face turned to the skies;</span><br />
The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On his fixed and glassy eyes.</span><br />
<br />
Then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That sav&egrave;d she might be;</span><br />
And she thought of Christ, who stilled the waves,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">On the Lake of Galilee.</span><br />
<br />
And fast through the midnight dark and drear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Through the whistling sleet and snow,</span><br />
Like a sheeted ghost, the vessel swept<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Towards the reef of Norman's Woe.</span><br />
<br />
And ever the fitful gusts between<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A sound came from the land;</span><br />
It was the sound of the trampling surf,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On the rocks and the hard sea-sand.</span><br />
<br />
The breakers were right beneath her bows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She drifted a weary wreck,</span><br />
And a whooping billow swept the crew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like icicles from her deck.</span><br />
<br />
She struck where the white and fleecy waves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Looked soft as carded wool,</span><br />
But the cruel rocks, they gored her side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like the horns of an angry bull.</span><br />
<br />
Her rattling shrouds, all sheathed in ice,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With the masts, went by the board;</span><br />
Like a vessel of glass, she stove and sank,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ho! ho! the breakers roared!</span><br />
<br />
At daybreak, on the bleak sea-beach,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A fisherman stood aghast,</span><br />
To see the form of a maiden fair,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lashed close to a drifting mast.</span><br />
<br />
The salt sea was frozen on her breast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The salt tears in her eyes;</span><br />
And he saw her hair, like the brown sea-weed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On the billows fall and rise.</span><br />
<br />
Such was the wreck of the Hesperus,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the midnight and the snow!</span><br />
Christ save us all from a death like this,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On the reef of Norman's Woe!</span><br />

Was never salmon yet that shone so fair<br />

They row'd her in across the rolling foam<br />

<h3><span class="smcap">How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix</span></h3>

<div class='poem2'>
I sprang to the stirrup, and Joris, and he;<br />
I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three;<br />
"Good speed!" cried the watch, as the gate-bolts undrew;<br />
"Speed!" echoed the wall to us galloping through;<br />
Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>And into the midnight we galloped abreast.<br />
<br />
Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace<br />
Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place;<br />
I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,<br />
Then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right,<br />
Rebuckled the cheek-strap, chained slacker the bit,<br />
Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.<br />
<br />
'Twas moonset at starting; but while we drew near<br />
Lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear;<br />
At Boom, a great yellow star came out to see;<br />
At D&uuml;ffield, 'twas morning as plain as could be;<br />
And from Mecheln church-steeple we heard the half-chime,<br />
So, Joris broke silence with, "Yet there is time!"<br />
<br />
At Aerschot, up leaped of a sudden the sun,<br />
And against him the cattle stood black every one,<br />
To stare thro' the mist at us galloping past,<br />
And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last,<br />
With resolute shoulders, each butting away<br />
The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray;<br />
<br />
And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track;<br />
And one eye's black intelligence,&mdash;ever that glance<br />
O'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance!<br />
And the thick heavy spume-flakes which aye and anon<br />
His fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on.<br />
<br />
By Hasselt, Dirck groaned; and cried Joris, "Stay spur!<br />
Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in her,<br />
We'll remember at Aix"&mdash;for one heard the quick wheeze<br />
Of her chest, saw the stretched neck and staggering knees,<br />
And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,<br />
As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.<br />
<br />
So, we were left galloping, Joris and I,<br />
Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;<br />
The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh,<br />
'Neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff;<br />
Till over by Dalhem a dome-spire sprang white,<br />
And "Gallop," gasped Joris, "for Aix is in sight!"<br />
<br />
"How they'll greet us!"&mdash;and all in a moment his roan<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>Rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone;<br />
And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight<br />
Of the news which alone could save Aix from her fate,<br />
With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,<br />
And with circles of red for his eye-sockets' rim.<br />
<br />
Then I cast loose my buffcoat, each holster let fall,<br />
Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all,<br />
Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear,<br />
Called my Roland his pet-name, my horse without peer;<br />
Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good,<br />
Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood.<br />
<br />
And all I remember is&mdash;friends flocking round<br />
As I sat with his head 'twixt my knees on the ground;<br />
And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,<br />
As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,<br />
Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)<br />
Was no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent.<br />

And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.<br />
<br />
Like the leaves of the forest when summer is green,<br />
That host with their banners at sunset were seen;<br />
Like the leaves of the forest when autumn hath blown,<br />
That host on the morrow lay wither'd and strown.<br />
<br />
For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,<br />
And breathed in the face of the foe as he pass'd;<br />
And the eyes of the sleepers wax'd deadly and chill,<br />
And their hearts but once heaved, and forever grew still.<br />
<br />
And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,<br />
But through it there roll'd not the breath of his pride:<br />
And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,<br />
And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.<br />
<br />
And there lay the rider, distorted and pale,<br />
With the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail;<br />
And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,<br />
The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.<br />
<br />
And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,<br />
And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal,<br />
And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,<br />
Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord.<br />

I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress:<br />

Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And from the noisome pestilence.</span><br />
He shall cover thee with his feathers,<br />
And under his wings shalt thou trust:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His truth shall be thy shield and buckler.</span><br />
Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor for the arrow that flieth by day;</span><br />
Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor for the destruction that wasteth by noon-day.</span><br />
A thousand shall fall at thy side,<br />
And ten thousand at thy right hand;<br />

Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And see the reward of the wicked.</span><br />

Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge,<br />

There shall no evil befall thee,<br />

They shall bear thee up in their hands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.</span><br />
Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.</span><br />
Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.</span><br />
He shall call upon me, and I will answer him:<br />

Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee<br />
Jest and youthful Jollity,<br />
Quips and Cranks, and wanton Wiles,<br />
Nods, and Becks, and wreath&egrave;d Smiles,<br />
Such as hang on Hebe's cheek,<br />
And love to live in dimple sleek;<br />
Sport that wrinkled Care derides,<br />
And Laughter holding both his sides.<br />
Come, and trip it as you go<br />
On the light fantastic toe;<br />
And in thy right hand lead with thee<br />
The mountain nymph, sweet Liberty;<br />
And if I give thee honour due,<br />
Mirth, admit me of thy crew,<br />
To live with her, and live with thee,<br />
In unreprov&egrave;d pleasures free;<br />
To hear the Lark begin his flight,<br />
And singing startle the dull night,<br />
From his watch-tower in the skies,<br />
Till the dappled dawn doth rise;<br />
Then to come, in spite of sorrow,<br />
And at my window bid good morrow,<br />
Through the sweetbrier, or the vine,<br />
Or the twisted eglantine:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>While the Cock with lively din,<br />
Scatters the rear of darkness thin,<br />
And to the stack, or the barn door,<br />
Stoutly struts his dames before,<br />
Oft list'ning how the hounds and horn<br />
Cheerly rouse the slumbering morn,<br />
From the side of some hoar hill,<br />
Through the high wood echoing shrill.<br />
Sometime walking not unseen<br />
By hedge-row elms, on hillocks green,<br />
Right against the eastern gate,<br />
Where the great Sun begins his state,<br />
Robed in flames and amber light,<br />
The clouds in thousand liveries dight:<br />
While the ploughman, near at hand,<br />
Whistles o'er the furrow'd land,<br />
And the milkmaid singeth blithe,<br />
And the mower whets his scythe,<br />
And every shepherd tells his tale<br />
Under the hawthorn in the dale.<br />

<h3><span class="smcap">The Revenge</span></h3>

<div class='center'>(A Ballad of the Fleet)</div>

<div class='poem2'>
At Flores in the Azores Sir Richard Grenville lay,<br />
And a pinnace, like a flutter'd bird, came flying from far away:<br />
"Spanish ships of war at sea! we have sighted fifty-three!"<br />
Then sware Lord Thomas Howard: "'Fore God I am no coward;<br />
But I cannot meet them here, for my ships are out of gear,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>And the half my men are sick. I must fly, but follow quick.<br />
We are six ships of the line; can we fight with fifty-three?"<br />
<br />
Then spake Sir Richard Grenville: "I know you are no coward;<br />
You fly them for a moment to fight with them again.<br />
But I've ninety men and more that are lying sick ashore.<br />
I should count myself the coward if I left them, my Lord Howard,<br />
To these Inquisition dogs and the devildoms of Spain."<br />
<br />
So Lord Howard past away with five ships of war that day,<br />
Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven;<br />
But Sir Richard bore in hand all his sick men from the land<br />
Very carefully and slow,<br />
Men of Bideford in Devon,<br />
And we laid them on the ballast down below;<br />
For we brought them all aboard,<br />
And they blest him in their pain, that they were not left to Spain,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>To the thumbscrew and the stake, for the glory of the Lord.<br />
He had only a hundred seamen to work the ship and to fight,<br />
And he sailed away from Flores till the Spaniard came in sight,<br />
With his huge sea-castles heaving upon the weather bow.<br />
"Shall we fight or shall we fly?<br />
Good Sir Richard, tell us now,<br />
For to fight is but to die!<br />
There'll be little of us left by the time this sun be set."<br />
And Sir Richard said again: "We be all good English men.<br />
Let us bang these dogs of Seville, the children of the devil,<br />
For I never turn'd my back upon Don or devil yet."<br />
<br />
Sir Richard spoke and he laugh'd, and we roar'd a hurrah, and so<br />
The little Revenge ran on sheer into the heart of the foe,<br />
With her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below;<br />
For half of their fleet to the right and half to the left were seen,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>And the little Revenge ran on thro' the long sea-lane between.<br />
Thousands of their soldiers look'd down from their decks and laugh'd,<br />
Thousands of their seamen made mock at the mad little craft<br />
Running on and on, till delay'd<br />
By their mountain-like San Philip that, of fifteen hundred tons,<br />
And up-shadowing high above us with her yawning tiers of guns,<br />
Took the breath from our sails, and we stay'd.<br />
<br />
And while now the great San Philip hung above us like a cloud<br />
Whence the thunderbolt will fall<br />
Long and loud,<br />
Four galleons drew away<br />
From the Spanish fleet that day,<br />
And two upon the larboard and two upon the starboard lay,<br />
And the battle-thunder broke from them all.<br />
<br />
But anon the great San Philip, she bethought herself and went<br />
Having that within her womb that had left her ill content;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>And the rest they came aboard us, and they fought us hand to hand,<br />
For a dozen times they came with their pikes and musqueteers,<br />
And a dozen times we shook 'em off as a dog that shakes his ears<br />
When he leaps from the water to the land.<br />
<br />
And the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer sea,<br />
But never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three.<br />
Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came,<br />
Ship after ship, the whole night long, with her battle-thunder and flame;<br />
Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and her shame.<br />
And some were sunk and many were shatter'd, and so could fight us no more&mdash;<br />
God of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before?<br />
<br />
For he said "Fight on! fight on!"<br />
Tho' his vessel was all but a wreck;<br />
And it chanced that, when half of the short summer night was gone,<br />
With a grisly wound to be drest he had left the deck,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>But a bullet struck him that was dressing it suddenly dead,<br />
And himself he was wounded again in the side and the head,<br />
And he said "Fight on! fight on!"<br />
<br />
And the night went down, and the sun smiled out far over the summer sea,<br />
And the Spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring;<br />
But they dared not touch us again, for they fear'd that we still could sting,<br />
So they watch'd what the end would be.<br />
And we had not fought them in vain,<br />
But in perilous plight were we,<br />
Seeing forty of our poor hundred were slain,<br />
And half of the rest of us maim'd for life<br />
In the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife;<br />
And the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and cold,<br />
And the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was all of it spent;<br />
And the masts and the rigging were lying over the side;<br />
But Sir Richard cried in his English pride,<br />
"We have fought such a fight for a day and a night<br />
As may never be fought again!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>We have won great glory, my men!<br />
And a day less or more<br />
At sea or ashore,<br />
We die&mdash;does it matter when?<br />
Sink me the ship, Master Gunner&mdash;sink her, split her in twain!<br />
Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!"<br />
<br />
And the gunner said, "Ay, ay," but the seamen made reply:<br />
"We have children, we have wives,<br />
And the Lord hath spared our lives.<br />
We will make the Spaniard promise, if we yield, to let us go;<br />
We shall live to fight again and to strike another blow."<br />
And the lion there lay dying, and they yielded to the foe.<br />
<br />
And the stately Spanish men to their flagship bore him then,<br />
Where they laid him by the mast, old Sir Richard caught at last,<br />
And they praised him to his face with their courtly foreign grace;<br />
But he rose upon their decks, and he cried:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>"I have fought for Queen and Faith like a valiant man and true;<br />
I have only done my duty as a man is bound to do;<br />
With a joyful spirit I Sir Richard Grenville die!"<br />
And he fell upon their decks, and he died.<br />
<br />
And they stared at the dead that had been so valiant and true,<br />
And had holden the power and glory of Spain so cheap<br />
That he dared her with one little ship and his English few;<br />
Was he devil or man? He was devil for aught they knew,<br />
But they sank his body with honour down into the deep,<br />
And they mann'd the Revenge with a swarthier alien crew,<br />
And away she sail'd with her loss and long'd for her own;<br />
When a wind from the lands they had ruin'd awoke from sleep,<br />
And the water began to heave and the weather to moan,<br />
And or ever that evening ended a great gale blew,<br />
And a wave like the wave that is raised by an earthquake grew,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>Till it smote on their hulls and their sails and their masts and their flags,<br />
And the whole sea plunged and fell on the shot-shatter'd navy of Spain,<br />
And the little Revenge herself went down by the island crags<br />
To be lost evermore in the main.<br />

How sleep the brave, who sink to rest<br />

When Spring, with dewy fingers cold,<br />

Than Fancy's feet have ever trod.<br />

By fairy hands their knell is rung,<br />
By forms unseen their dirge is sung:<br />
There Honour comes, a pilgrim gray,<br />

And Freedom shall awhile repair<br />
To dwell a weeping hermit there!<br />

Oh! give me the flashing brine,<br />

<br />
Once more on the deck I stand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of my own swift-gliding craft:</span><br />
Set sail! farewell to the land!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gale follows fair abaft.</span><br />
We shoot through the sparkling foam<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like an ocean-bird set free:</span><br />
Like the ocean-bird, our home<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We'll find far out on the sea.</span><br />
<br />
The land is no longer in view,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The clouds have begun to frown:</span><br />
But with a stout vessel and crew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We'll say, Let the storm come down!</span><br />
And the song of our heart shall be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the winds and waters rave,</span><br />
A home on the rolling sea!<br />

Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place<br />
In all generations.<br />
<br />
Before the mountains were brought forth,<br />
Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.</span><br />
Thou turnest man to destruction;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And sayest, Return, ye children of men.</span><br />
For a thousand years in thy sight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Are but as yesterday when it is past,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And as a watch in the night.</span><br />
Thou carriest them away as with a flood;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They are as a sleep:</span><br />
In the morning they are like grass which groweth up.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the evening it is cut down, and withereth.</span><br />
<br />
For we are consumed by thine anger,<br />
And by thy wrath are we troubled.<br />
<br />
Thou hast set our iniquities before thee,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.</span><br />
For all our days are passed away in thy wrath:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We spend our years as a tale that is told.</span><br />
The days of our years are threescore years and ten;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And if by reason of strength they be fourscore years,</span><br />
Yet is their strength labour and sorrow;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</span><br />
Who knoweth the power of thine anger?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.</span><br />
<br />
So teach us to number our days,<br />
That we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.<br />
<br />
Return, O Lord, how long?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And let it repent thee concerning thy servants.</span><br />
O satisfy us early with thy mercy;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</span><br />
Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the years wherein we have seen evil.</span><br />
Let thy work appear unto thy servants,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And thy glory unto their children.</span><br />
And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us:<br />

I wandered lonely as a cloud<br />
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br />
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br />
A host of golden daffodils;<br />
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br />
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br />
<br />
Continuous as the stars that shine<br />
And twinkle on the milky way,<br />
They stretched in never-ending line<br />
Along the margin of a bay:<br />
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br />
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br />
<br />
The waves beside them danced, but they<br />
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:&mdash;<br />
A poet could not but be gay,<br />
In such a jocund company;<br />
I gazed&mdash;and gazed&mdash;but little thought<br />
What wealth the show to me had brought:<br />
<br />
For oft, when on my couch I lie<br />
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br />
They flash upon that inward eye<br />
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br />
And then my heart with pleasure fills<br />
And dances with the daffodils.<br />

In Gulfs enchanted, where the Siren sings,<br />

And the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.<br />
<br />
Its webs of living gauze no more unfurl;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Wrecked is the ship of pearl!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And every chambered cell,</span><br />
Where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell,<br />
As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Before thee lies revealed,&mdash;</span><br />
Its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed!<br />
<br />
Year after year beheld the silent toil<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">That spread his lustrous coil;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Still, as the spiral grew,</span><br />

Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee,<br />

From thy dead lips a clearer note is born<br />
Than ever Triton blew from Wreath&egrave;d Horn!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">While on mine ear it rings,</span><br />
Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings:&mdash;<br />

Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">As the swift seasons roll!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Leave thy low-vaulted past!</span><br />
Let each new temple, nobler than the last,<br />
Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,<br />

Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea!<br />

Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness!<br />
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;<br />
Conspiring with him how to load and bless<br />

To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,<br />
And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells<br />

Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?<br />
Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find<br />
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,<br />
Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;<br />
Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,<br />
Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook<br />
Spares the next swath and all its twin&egrave;d flowers;<br />
And sometime like a gleaner thou dost keep<br />
Steady thy laden head across a brook;<br />
Or by a cider-press, with patient look,<br />
Thou watchest the last oozings, hours by hours.<br />

Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?<br />
Think not of them,&mdash;thou hast thy music too,<br />
While barr&egrave;d clouds bloom the soft-dying day<br />
And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;<br />
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn<br />
Among the river-sallows, borne aloft<br />
Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;<br />
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;<br />
Hedge-crickets sing, and now with treble soft<br />
The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft,<br />
And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.<br />

Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest<br />
And scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Soon o'er thy sheltered nest.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Thou'rt gone&mdash;the abyss of heaven</span><br />
Hath swallow'd up thy form&mdash;yet on my heart<br />
Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And shall not soon depart.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">He, who from zone to zone</span><br />
Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,<br />
In the long way that I must tread alone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Will lead my steps aright.</span><br />

Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Round many western islands have I been</span><br />
Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.<br />
Oft of one wide expanse had I been told<br />

Then felt I like some watcher of the skies<br />

The king sits in Dunfermline town<br />

"O whare will I get a skeely skipper<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">To sail this new ship o' mine?"</span><br />

O up and spak an eldern knight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sat at the king's right knee:</span><br />
"Sir Patrick Spens is the best sailor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That ever sail'd the sea."</span><br />
<br />
Our king has written a braid letter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And seal'd it with his hand,</span><br />
And sent it to Sir Patrick Spens,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Was walking on the strand.</span><br />
<br />
"To Noroway, to Noroway,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To Noroway o'er the faem;</span><br />
The king's daughter o' Noroway,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tis thou must bring her hame."</span><br />
<br />
The first word that Sir Patrick read<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So loud, loud laugh'd he;</span><br />
The neist word that Sir Patrick read<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The tear blinded his e'e.</span><br />
<br />
"O wha is this has done this deed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And tauld the king o' me,</span><br />
To send us out, at this time o' year,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To sail upon the sea?</span><br />
<br />
"Be it wind, be it weet, be it hail, be it sleet,<br />

"Now ever alack, my master dear,<br />

And if we gang to sea, master,<br />

<br />
They hadna sail'd a league, a league,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A league but barely three,</span><br />
When the lift grew dark, and the wind blew loud,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And gurly grew the sea.</span><br />
<br />
The ankers brak, and the topmast lap,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It was sic a deadly storm:</span><br />

<h3><span class="smcap">Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard</span></h3>

<div class='poem'>
The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,</span><br />
The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And leaves the world to darkness and to me.</span><br />
<br />
Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all the air a solemn stillness holds,</span><br />
Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:</span><br />
<br />
Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tow'r<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The moping owl does to the moon complain</span><br />
Of such as, wand'ring near her secret bow'r,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Molest her ancient solitary reign.</span><br />
<br />
Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where heaves the turf in many a mould'ring heap,</span><br />
Each in his narrow cell forever laid,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.</span><br />
<br />
The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The swallow twitt'ring from the straw-built shed,</span><br />
The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.</span><br />
<br />
For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or busy housewife ply her evening care:</span><br />
No children run to lisp their sire's return,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.</span><br />
<br />
Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke:</span><br />
How jocund did they drive their team afield!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!</span><br />
<br />
Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;</span><br />
Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The short and simple annals of the poor.</span><br />
<br />
The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,</span><br />
Await alike th' inevitable hour:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The paths of glory lead but to the grave.</span><br />
<br />
Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">If Memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise,</span><br />
Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.</span><br />
<br />
Can storied urn or animated bust<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?</span><br />
Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of death?</span><br />
<br />
Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;</span><br />
Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre.</span><br />
<br />
But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll;</span><br />
Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And froze the genial current of the soul.</span><br />
<br />
Full many a gem of purest ray serene<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:</span><br />
Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And waste its sweetness on the desert air.</span><br />
<br />
Some village Hampden that with dauntless breast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The little tyrant of his fields withstood,</span><br />
Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some Cromwell guiltless of his country's blood.</span><br />
<br />
Th' applause of list'ning senates to command,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The threats of pain and ruin to despise,</span><br />
To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And read their history in a nation's eyes&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Their lot forbade: nor circumscribed alone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined;</span><br />
Forbade to wade thro' slaughter to a throne,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shut the gates of mercy on mankind;</span><br />
<br />
The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame</span><br />
Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With incense kindled at the Muse's flame.</span><br />
<br />
Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;</span><br />
Along the cool, sequester'd vale of life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.</span><br />
<br />
Yet ev'n these bones from insult to protect<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some frail memorial still erected nigh,</span><br />
With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.</span><br />
<br />
Their name, their years, spelt by th' unlettered Muse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The place of fame and elegy supply:</span><br />
And many a holy text around she strews,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">That teach the rustic moralist to die.</span><br />
<br />
For who, to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,</span><br />
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor cast one longing ling'ring look behind?</span><br />
<br />
On some fond breast the parting soul relies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some pious drops the closing eye requires;</span><br />
E'en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">E'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.</span><br />
<br />
For thee, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;</span><br />
If chance, by lonely contemplation led,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn</span><br />
Brushing with hasty steps the dews away<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To meet the sun upon the upland lawn.</span><br />
<br />
"There at the foot of yonder nodding beech<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,</span><br />
His listless length at noontide would he stretch,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pore upon the brook that babbles by.</span><br />
<br />
"Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mutt'ring his wayward fancies he would rove,</span><br />
Now drooping, woeful-wan, like one forlorn,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or crazed with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.</span><br />
<br />
"One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Along the heath, and near his favourite tree;</span><br />
Another came; nor yet beside the rill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he:</span><br />
<br />
"The next with dirges due in sad array<br />

Bless the Lord, O my soul:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And all that is within me, bless his holy name.</span><br />
Bless the Lord, O my soul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And forget not all his benefits:</span><br />
Who forgiveth all thine iniquities;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who healeth all thy diseases;</span><br />
Who redeemeth thy life from destruction;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies;</span><br />
Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.</span><br />
<br />
The Lord executeth righteousness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And judgment for all that are oppressed.</span><br />
He made known his ways unto Moses,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His acts unto the children of Israel.</span><br />
The Lord is merciful and gracious,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.</span><br />
He will not always chide:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Neither will he keep his anger forever.</span><br />
He hath not dealt with us after our sins;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</span><br />
<br />
For as the heaven is high above the earth,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">So great is his mercy toward them that fear him.</span><br />
As far as the east is from the west,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</span><br />
Like as a father pitieth his children,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</span><br />
For he knoweth our frame;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He remembereth that we are dust.</span><br />
<br />
As for man, his days are as grass:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.</span><br />
For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the place thereof shall know it no more.</span><br />
But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And his righteousness unto children's children;</span><br />
To such as keep his covenant,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And to those that remember his commandments to do them.</span><br />
<br />
The Lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And his kingdom ruleth over all.</span><br />
Bless the Lord, ye his angels,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That excel in strength,</span><br />
That do his commandments,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hearkening unto the voice of his word.</span><br />
Bless ye the Lord, all ye his hosts;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.</span><br />
Bless the Lord, all his works<br />

<h2>ANTHOLOGIES OF CHILDREN'S POEMS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> addition to what the student has mastered by
heart he needs to own and keep within arm's reach
a good anthology. He should first own "A Children's
Treasury of English Song," and about the
time he is ready to leave the elementary school the
greatest of all collections of verse, "The Golden
Treasury of the Best Songs and Lyrical Poems in
the English Language," must fall into his hands.
The next best collection is doubtless "The Oxford
Book of English Verse," by A. T. Quiller-Couch.
For ballad literature "The Oxford Book of English
Ballads" by the last-named editor and "The
Ballad Book" by Allingham are both good. It
is to be hoped that if he has a taste for verse of
the ballad form, the boy may some day wander
back to Percy's "Reliques of Ancient English
Poetry." An occasional boy who cares little for
great poetry may have a bent toward songs of
war and daring. Though this tendency is to be
deplored if it comes late in the boy's school life,
it is best to satisfy it. A fairly good but not altogether
judiciously selected anthology for this purpose
is Henley's "Lyra Heroica." From this reading
of poetry in anthologies the boy might go to
the carefully edited and selected volumes of the great
poets in the Golden Treasury Series. The step to
choice complete editions is then easy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>It may chance that the boy who has once tasted
of the honeydew of great poetry and who has left
the elementary school to take up the actual affairs
of life will go back to the authority of his teacher who
first pointed out to him such a pure pleasure for his
quiet hours. If this gratifying condition should
come about, the teacher might name to him the
following poems that are still more rare in their
appeal&mdash;as he will surely come to know when
he has felt the touch of "An Ode on a Grecian
Urn." Here are the titles: "Shall I Compare
Thee to a Summer's Day," Shakespeare; "The Time
of Year Thou May'st in Me Behold," Shakespeare;
"On the Late Massacre in Piedmont," Milton;
"The World is too Much with Us," Wordsworth;
"Milton, Thou Should'st Be Living at This Hour,"
Wordsworth; "Tuscan, That Wander'st in the
Realms of Gloom," Longfellow; "Rose Aylmer,"
Landor; "Out of the Night That Covers Me," Henley;
"Go Fetch to Me a Pint o' Wine," Burns; "Proud
Maisie is in the Woods," Scott; "She Dwelt among
the Untrodden Ways," Wordsworth; "Helen, Thy
Beauty is to Me," Poe; "She Walks in Beauty,"
Byron; "The Lost Leader," Browning; "It Was
a Lover and His Lass," Shakespeare; "Callicles
beneath Etna," Arnold; "La Belle Dame sans
Merci," Keats; "Ode to Evening," Collins; "Ode
to a Skylark," Shelley; "Ode on a Grecian Urn,"
Keats; "Kubla Khan," Coleridge; "Ulysses,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Tennyson; "L'Allegro," Milton. From these the
boy may with the coming of manhood be led to
heights of such tunes of the masters as Wordsworth's
powerful "Ode on the Intimations of Immortality
from Earliest Childhood," and Tennyson's song
that is so near to the heart of great things, "In
Memoriam."</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FAIRY TALES, HOUSEHOLD TALES, AND OTHER FANCIFUL STORIES</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the olde times they were the only revivers of drowsy age at midnight:
old and young have with his tales chim'd mattens till the cocks
crow in the morning: Batchelors and Maides with his tales have compassed
the Christmas fire-block till the Curfew-bell rings, Candle out:
the old Shepherd and the young Plow boy after their day's labour have
carol'd out a Tale of Tom Thumb to make merry with: and who but
little Tom hath made long nights seem short and heavy toyles easie?"</p>

<div class='right'>
&mdash;Said in 1611 of the Tales of Tom Thumb.<br />
</div><br /></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> that comforting essay, "An Apology for Idlers,"
Robert Louis Stevenson tells us that it is by no means
certain that a man's business is the most important
thing that he has to do. And somewhere else he
has remarked on a club of men in Brussels who
talked about the commercial affairs of Belgium during
the day, but who at night came together to
discuss the more serious affairs of life. These views
are in accord with the Stevenson temperament
that looked on life as made up of two worlds: a
real workaday one to be unflinchingly faced, no
matter what the task that came, and a fanciful one,
a play world, that by its appeal to the ideal nature
created an atmosphere of joy that made the duties
of the real one more tolerable. His own life, so well
balanced between work and play, so sane and healthful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and inspiring in its influence on all who knew him
or read his books, has shown what a romantic cast
of mind can get out of life, though it suffer the handicap
of ill health and worldly misfortune. The
balance-wheel of his life was a playful imagination
that always "hath made long nights seem short
and heavy toyles easie."</p>

<p>Stern materialism, cold, calculatingly just, impatient
with the dreamer, with no charity for lovable
human frailties, has always mocked at the notion of
a fanciful place where great and glorious things are
going on. She spins no web from the threads of her
imagination. The warp and woof of her fabric are
drawn from facts; and it comes from the loom all
wool, a yard wide, and used to cover the nakedness
of real men and women. She has never felt the free
abandon of fairy land. Her heart has never leap'd
up at beholding a rainbow in the sky, a rainbow with
the fabled pot of gold&mdash;though she has toiled and
sweat many a day for nothing more than a mess of
pottage. Whilst pointing the finger of scorn at the
magic lamp, the ogre's hen, or the seven-league
boots, she plays the fool and pays the fiddler in actual
life merely because under it all there lurks a passion
for the marvellous, founded on chance. In the business
world this manifests itself in the perennial hope
of a "bull market" or a "bonanza." Of course,
pleasures are largely a question of taste, not a question
of right, and it is everybody to his liking,&mdash;one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
may prefer the counting house to the back-log at the
drowsy hour of midnight,&mdash;yet may we all be spared
the time when fancy and romance cease to dominate
men. Without them life would become mediocre,
stupid, dull.</p>

<p>It has been claimed that a nation without fancy
and romance never can hold a great place. Material
prosperity without a corresponding well-being in the
things of the imagination is an unfortunate prosperity.
Its pleasures must necessarily be sensual
pleasures that grow out of luxury. They carry the
man or woman too far away from the land of childhood.
Dickens saw this clearly when he said:
"What enchanted us in childhood and is captivating
a million young fancies now, has at the same blessed
time of life, enchanted vast hosts of men and women
who have done their long day's work, and laid their
gray heads down to rest. It has greatly helped to
keep us in some sense ever young, by preserving
through our worldly ways one slender tract not overgrown
with weeds, where we may walk with children
sharing their delights." A good thing it is to keep
that slender tract free from weeds. And the stronger
the man, the more he needs to do it. Only a man who
sees things out of their right proportions and who is
without a sense of humour would scorn to renew his
youth occasionally in the land of romance. If in
life the strongest and wisest men are good at a fight,
they are still better at a play. And it is no shame if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
their "Arabian Nights' Entertainments" is more
thumbed than their Bacon's "Essays." They may
be all the wiser for it. In Howard Pyle's delightful
rendering of the Robin Hood tales he gives this happy
admonition in the introduction: "You who so plod
among serious things that you feel it a shame to give
yourself up even for a few short moments to mirth
and joyousness in the land of Fancy; you who think
that life hath naught to do with innocent laughter
that can harm no one; these pages are not for
you. Clap the leaves and go no further than this,
for I tell you plainly that if you will go further you
will be so scandalized by seeing good, sober folk of
real history so frisk and caper in gay colours and
motley that you would not know them but for the
names tagged to them." And then he sees the
secret of making the heart beat young whilst carrying
the burdens of grown-up life, and he says, "The
land of Fancy is of that pleasant kind that, when
you tire of it,&mdash;whisk,&mdash;you clap the leaves of this
book together and 'tis gone, and you are ready for
everyday life, with no harm done."</p>

<p>The present age as it gives colouring to educational
practices is a matter-of-fact age. Whilst boasting
of freedom of thought, it has fallen into a despotism
of fact. Like the Old Man of the Sea, this reign of
fact has been clutching at the neck of culture and
railing at the play of fancy until there is but precious
little of the "merrie" life left to look to. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
men who cleared away the forest can be pardoned if
they lived their lives largely in the light of stern
fact, and so might the sons of these men; but those
as many generations removed as the present should
be able to drop back to the even tenor of a domestic
and school life that recognizes the play of fanciful
imagination as an essential part of the business of
living at all. No sooner had the founders of our
nation succeeded in giving men their long-coveted
political freedom than science, cock-sure of being
able to solve the riddle of existence, strode upon the
scene and smote the favourite creatures of the imagination
hip and thigh. It not only played havoc
with the fairies of our fathers, but it came perilously
near doing the same with their faith. And as a
result, a material and utilitarian tone has taken hold
of education in most places, and boys must be practical,
scientific, and wear old heads on young shoulders.
This same tendency had begun in the days of
Charles Lamb, for he wrote the following protest
to Coleridge: "Knowledge must now come to the
child in the shape of knowledge, and his empty noddle
must be turned with conceit at his own powers when
he has learnt that a horse is an animal and Billy is
better than a horse and such like; instead of that
beautiful interest in wild tales which made the child
a man while all the time he suspected himself to be
no bigger than a child. Science has succeeded to
poetry no less in the little walks of children than with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
men. Is there possibility of averting this sore
evil? Think of what you would have been now if,
instead of being fed with tales and old wives' fables
in childhood, you had been crammed with geography
and natural history." And what must be said to
supplanting the subject of fairy life by the anatomy
and physiology of the human body? Is not a boy
who knows the happy likeness of Old King Cole or
Allan-a-Dale as well educated as he who recognizes
the picture of an alcoholic liver? All this educational
pother about having boys practical and
trained to reason instead of being imaginative and
romantic will die of its own accord some day, and
then they may once more listen to merrie tales told
under the greenwood tree.</p>

<p>The boy who has been nurtured on tales of fancy
and who trusts to things to work out for the best
of their own accord will generally fall into ways of
cheerfulness and contentment. He will play the
game of life out with more of heart and courage, and
less of doubt and fear. He may be something of an
impractical dreamer, but he will be kind and true.
He will not aim to understand all mysteries and all
knowledge, but will aim to make people happy
rather than learned. His early experience of the
feelings of pity and terror will refine his emotions
as much as it did in the age of Thespias those of the
Greek youth. In other words, his early familiarity
with fairy tales, whether learned by word of mouth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
from his father, his nurse, or his teacher, will set his
face in the right direction. And to keep it so turned
he will of necessity have to build up a fairy library.
What that library might contain and what he should
know as a perfect lesson must now be considered.</p>

<p>A sense of fitness rather than a feeling of loyalty
to the language points to the English fairy and household
tales as the ones with which to begin. If the
teacher has a folk-lore curiosity and interest which
aid him in giving these fairy tales to the children,
that is well and good. But this historic view is by
no means so important as it is to know thoroughly
the tales themselves and to enter into an appreciation
of them with a keen and boyish interest. The
present concern is with a limited number of stories
that are so wholly good and so very necessary to the
child that he should come to know them completely.
Then from this beginning the boy can wander at his
own sweet will and keep friends with Jacobs, Perrault,
Grimm, Andersen, and, last of all and no doubt best
of all, "The Arabian Nights' Entertainments." But
from all of these the rude vigour, the dramatic directness,
and above all the playful humour of the English
tales will first captivate him. They have not quite
the grace, simplicity, and elegance of the French
tales, nor the more fanciful and romantic touches
of the German tales; yet, as Mr. Jacobs has told us,
"They have the quality of going home to English
children. The English folk-muse wears homespun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and plods afoot, albeit with a cheerful smile and a
steady gaze."</p>

<p>"English Fairy Tales" and "More English Fairy
Tales" should be in the hands of every child. The
stories are told in a way that preserves all of their
dramatic interest and humour of phrase and situation.
This characteristic humour of English folk-fancy, Mr.
Jacobs has skilfully caught. He has this to say of
his way of telling them: "I am inclined to follow
the traditions of my old nurse, who was not bred at
Girton and scorned at times the rules of Lindley
Murray and the diction of polite society. And I
have left vulgarisms in the mouths of vulgar people.
Children appreciate the dramatic propriety of this
as much as do their elders. Generally speaking, it
has been my ambition to write as a good old nurse
would speak when she tells Fairy Tales. I am doubtful
of my success in catching the colloquial-romantic
tone appropriate for such narratives, but they had
to be done or else my object, to give a book of English
Fairy Tales which children would listen to,
would have been unachieved. This book is to be
read aloud and not merely to be taken by the eye."
All children should rejoice, that, so long after Puritanism
had suppressed these tales in many parts of
England, and after its decline they had come to be
supplanted by the Mother Goose tales of Perrault,
there has come such an excellent retelling of them in
the Jacobs books. If there be anything in fairy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
literature better than "Tom Tit Tot," I have not
found it. It is altogether fitting to have it stand
first in such a great collection. And with other such
very good tales as "Cap o' Rushes," "The Three
Sillies," and "Jack and the Golden Snuff Box,"
to say nothing of the dramatic telling of "Hop o'
My Thumb," "Jack the Giant Killer," and "Jack
and the Bean Stalk," the pleasure from reading the
book at the right age will mayhap never be surpassed.
One might regret that the curious and helpful
information of the notes had not been reserved
for a separate treatise for mature readers, did not
the amusing illustration of the court-crier by John
D. Batton give the warning that the tales are closed
and children must not read any further. After having
learned some of the best stories through the ear,
the boy must certainly buy and keep these two books.</p>

<p>After the English tales are familiar, the boy might
be given the Mother Goose tales as first collected
by Charles Perrault in 1696. They had been current
orally in France for many years before this, and they
undoubtedly had their origin in the oldest folk-lore
of the world. It is said Perrault wrote them
down as he heard them with the intention of writing
them over in verse after the manner of the fables
done by La Fontaine. But his little son, to whom
they had been told, rewrote them from memory as
an exercise, and the lad's version, being so simple and
direct, was given to the world in that form by his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
father. They slowly found their way into England
and for a while supplanted the native tales. There
is surely a universal appeal in such stories as "Little
Red Riding Hood," "Cinderella," "Puss in Boots,"
and "Sleeping Beauty." The best rendering of
these to-day is a small volume by Charles Welsh,
entitled "The Tales of Mother Goose." It has
none of the poetic justice that refuses to have the
wolf eat up Little Red Riding Hood. It would be
well for some publisher to reprint an edition issued
in New York in 1795 under the title of "Tales of
Passed Times, by Mother Goose." Some good renderings
of particular tales, however, may be found
scattered through collections of fairy stories that
have appeared.</p>

<p>The temptation to say something about the
famous "Cruikshank Fairy Book" in which some of
these Mother Goose tales appeared cannot be resisted
at this point. It is a very noticeable illustration
of the inability of a man of talent always to
keep to his last. No artist has ever drawn such
superior pictures for children as did Cruikshank.
Where can anything better be found than Jack's
descent on the harp, the Ogre's flight, or the presentation
of the boots to the King? Why then did not
Cruikshank make a picture book with pictures
only? Why did he leave his last to write the stories
anew in order that he might take the opportunity
to give his own views and convictions on what he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
considered important social and educational questions;
or "to introduce a few temperance truths
with a fervent hope that some good may result
therefrom"? The notion that moralizing makes
children good has spoiled many an artistic horn
and has never made a good educational spoon.</p>

<p>In Cruikshank's work in illustrating "Household
and Fairy Tales" by the brothers Grimm, we
have a masterful production from the best period
of his genius, and we have it illustrating a superior
text, the translation made by Edward Taylor in
1823 and reprinted in 1868 with an introduction
by John Ruskin. Thackeray said that they had
been the first real, kindly, agreeable, and infinitely
amusing and charming illustrations for a child's
book in England, and that they united beauty,
fun, and fancy. And who was a better judge of
this than Thackeray? If it was not too bold to
say that "Tom Tit Tot" is the best household
fairy story in the language, it could be said with
equal truth that Cruikshank's etching of the two
elves in "The Elves and the Shoemaker" is the
best fairy illustration yet done. These German
stories are charming. The contention that the
stories are creepy is but the contention of a moralist.
It should carry no weight with the teacher who would
give the boy artistic notions of beauty, love, and
mystery. These notions are always safer than those
of cold realism worked out in artificial conduct. Sir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Walter Scott wrote in this strain to Edward Taylor
in 1832: "There is a sort of wild fairy interest in
them which makes me think them fully better
adapted to awaken the imagination and soften the
heart of childhood than the good boy stories which
have in late years been composed for them. In
the latter case, their minds are, as it were, put into
stocks, like their feet at the dancing-school, and the
moral always consists in good moral conduct being
crowned with temporal success. Truth is, I would
not give one tear shed over Little Red Riding Hood
for all the benefit to be derived from a hundred
histories of Johnny Goodchild. In a word, I think
the selfish tendencies will soon enough be acquired
in this arithmetical age; and that, to make the
higher class of character, our wild fictions&mdash;like
our own simple music&mdash;will have more effect in
awakening the fancy and elevating the disposition
than the colder and more elaborate compositions of
modern authors and composers." It is hoped the
pictures of Cruikshank and the translation of Taylor
will soon appear in a large and attractive volume.</p>

<p>When the dramatic colloquialism and humour of
the English tales, the superior grace, elegance, and
beauty of the French tales, and the light, airy fancy
of the German tales have been presented to the boy,
the Scandinavian tales of Hans Christian Andersen
will give him a refinement in fairy life that he has
not found before. They do not have, save in a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
such cases as "Holger the Dane," the quality of
appealing to grown-ups as well as to children&mdash;the
test of a child's book that is literature, or rather the
test of a man yet on good terms with the world.
They are somewhat dull, wearisome, and overdone
in places and do not stop when the story is ended,
as we find in "The Fir Tree"; yet in some way
they temper the English and German tales and meet
Ruskin's requirement that a child's tale should
sometimes be both sweet and sad. In fact, these
stories are great favourites with many children, who
actually prefer "The Ugly Duckling" to "The
Golden Bird." The boy might early start with a few
of the individual stories so delightfully illustrated
by Helen Stratton, and then when he can afford it
buy the excellent edition illustrated by the Danish
artist, Hans Tegner, from all of which he will get a
new and pleasant touch of fairy life.</p>

<p>There yet remains one book, not always called
a fairy book, that must be read before the boy leaves
the land of fancy and wonder. It was the favourite
volume of Stevenson, and small surprise is it to
any one who knows the book and knows of the man.
Nor is it less surprising to think that the Oriental
scholar, Antoine Galland, who first gave these
stories to Europe two hundred years ago, would be
called out of bed at night to tell them to an eager
crowd under his window, the crowd always begging
for just one story more. One might search in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
vain for a companion volume to this most capital
of all books, "The Arabian Nights' Entertainments."
The tales are on a bigger scale than are the English
and German tales. There is a vastness of desert
and starry sky in the tent life of the Arab that is
unknown in the cottage life of the English peasant.
And this is reflected in the tale that is told. Immensity
and Oriental mystery have taken the place
of colloquial directness and humour, and we have
almost pure romance. Their richness and splendour
captivate the reader and transport him into a wonderland
of powerful magicians and magnificent palaces.
The book is elemental in its appeal and will always
furnish royal entertainment for man or boy. And
the man who is not too completely grown up will
keep his Lane's translation within arm's reach against
the hours when the dull cares of the world are weighing
him down.</p>

<p>As fairy tales have a common plot in many languages,
so has there been a common way of preserving
and transmitting them. This has been by oral
tradition. They were originally to be given by word
of mouth, a method that is yet best fitted to curious
children. The teacher must give them through the
ear, if they are to be learned and retained. Whenever
it is possible in doing this, he must not forget
to start with the pleasant beginning, "once upon a
time," nor yet to omit the best of all conclusions,
"and all went well ever afterwards"&mdash;neglecting,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of course, to add that truism for grown-ups, "that
didn't go ill." In this practice of giving a few choice
tales through the ear is the preparation for the time
when a boy will eagerly thumb a favourite volume of
his own in some quiet nook. But a few of the
better tales must first have been mastered so that
they can be told with dramatic directness. Here
then the same practice must hold that is followed in
all reading: do not overread. A few stories are to
be well learned and a few books to be owned, but
only a few. If the boy once comes to feel his strength
from a limited number of good stories, the made-to-order
story for the fellow with the curls will never
appeal to him. What he knows he will know and
be glad to know.</p>

<p>If it be presumption to select a limited list of
stories by grades when the world is so full of stories,
it must be presumption. There are stories that can
have no substitutes until the world has had another
accumulated experience of some hundreds of years
of fireside lore. The list that follows has been found
good for a limited list, yet as complete a one as a
child can master. No apology need be offered for
the insertion of Ruskin's great story or the two stories
of jungle life by Kipling. They are modern, but
form a good bridge to modern books that have
real merit. A boy who will not read "Red Dog"
with an interest on fire had better grow weak on
a Rollo book. His taste is surely to be lamented.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
He will early fall in love and later fall into cynicism.</p>

<p>Here is the list for the first four or five grades to
be given in about the order in which they are written:
"The Old Woman and Her Pig," "The Three Little
Pigs," and "Henny-Penny," all as told by Jacobs in
"English Fairy Tales"; "The Three Bears" as
told by the poet Southey, where the little old woman
continues to play a part; "Little Red Riding
Hood" in which the wolf eats her up, "Cinderella;
or, the Glass Slipper," and "The Master Cat; or,
Puss in Boots" from "The Tales of Mother Goose"
as told by Charles Welsh; "Tom Tit Tot," "The
History of Tom Thumb," "Jack the Giant Killer,"
and "Whittington and His Cat" from "English
Fairy Tales"; "Beauty and the Beast" and "Hop
o' My Thumb" from "The Children's Book";
"Hansel and Grethel," "The Blue Light," and
"The Golden Bird" from Taylor's translation of
the Grimm tales; "The Ugly Duckling" and "The
Fir Tree" from Andersen; "The Story of Aladdin;
or, the Wonderful Lamp," "The History of Ali
Baba and the Forty Robbers Killed by One Slave,"
and "The Story of Sinbad the Sailor" from "The
Arabian Nights' Entertainments"; "The King of
the Golden River" by John Ruskin; "Kaa's Hunting"
and "Red Dog" from "The Jungle Books"
of Rudyard Kipling.</p>

<p>When these stories have been well learned through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the ear, their purpose as literature and as groundwork
for narrative speech will have been accomplished.
Of course, the teacher must read many stories to
his class besides the ones named above; but he is
not to require more than a mere listening to the
reading from a point of interest only. By and by
the boy will fall into the habit of reading aloud
to some one else, and this may now be trusted to
carry him along. Wise suggestion on the part of
the teacher will direct him in getting a few good
volumes that he can call his own. A fairy library,
not large but well selected, will become a comfort
to him in later years when the lamp is getting dim.
For the man who finds himself unable to read with
pleasure a fairy tale that charmed him in youth
proclaims himself a slave either to relentless materialism
or to cold and dignified egotism. And if he
be not obstinately short-sighted, he cannot help seeing
that the man who yet loves a fairy tale is one
who also fears God, is clear of head, and is brave
of heart.</p>

<p>In the succession of the seasons, the coming of
spring puts young blood into old veins much as
it dresses the gray of winter in a lively green. The
possibilities of the daughter of Ceres while she dwells
beneath the earth are likewise to be found between
the covers of a fairy library. A man might travel
many a long way in search of a better fountain of
youth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is not the slightest necessity for schoolmen's
staring at one another when it is proposed
to let boys once more look through magic casements
at the classic myths of Greece and Rome. These
masters of knowledge can depend upon it that their
pedagogic systems are wrong if they set themselves
up against the primitive feelings of mystery and fear.
There is yet too strong a trace in the blood to forsake
the gods and heroes that have satisfied instincts,
very human and commendable, for many generations.
No goblin nor witch needs to be cast out
when the blood flows red; it is merely an indication
of abundant life drawn from the strength and courage
that marked an heroic age. If a boy's talents
be anything but mediocre, they will naturally turn
to this age to satisfy a longing. It is small wonder
that the young Keats should stay up all night
reading Chapman's Homer, or should translate the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
&AElig;neid into English "just for fun." These glimpses
were pure serene to a poet who afterwards caught
in such a rare way their classic beauty; and the gods
surely loved him for it, for they decreed that he
should die young.</p>

<p>The charm of the myths of Greek and Roman
literature is enduring, because they embody both
truth and beauty&mdash;sometimes held to be one and
the same. Nothing but a perverted taste, that is
fed on the prosaic processes of material achievements
or the artificial standards of a moral system, could
fail to find pleasure and inspiration in them. Their
appeal is artistic, to the sense of beauty. Their
truth is a deification of the longings of the human
heart as it seeks for comfort and protection in a
world whose mysterious events can hardly be fathomed.
And their gods and heroes embody the great
virtues that marked a classic people as much as they
did the beauty of their intellectual achievements&mdash;the
virtues of courage, patience, honour, loyalty,
contentment. A normal disposition will take satisfaction
in this interpretation of truth and beauty.
Not only will its possessor be satisfied, but he will be
ennobled by the very presence of these qualities
before his keen senses. The world will seem to
him more than a place in which he is to toil and spin
day after day; his soul will dwell apart on a mountain
where not all mortals can ever climb, a mountain
crowded with culture. He can temporarily leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the common crofts, seek his solace and confession,
and be all the better to ply again his allotted task.
He will learn of one spot where the greed and
brutality of industrial progress cannot set its heel
and leave the print of what is practical and ugly.</p>

<p>This cry for the practical has laid a curse on the
culture of many a boy. He has been educated for
the eight or ten hours that he works for his board
and keep, and the rest of his waking day finds him
ill at ease in a field of study or an appreciation of
the better things of life. Not being able to "speak
Greek" or to talk with men who do speak Greek,
he naturally turns to the spectacular, the ornate,
the frivolous. Nothing of an order above the broadly
burlesque or the melodramatic will hold his interest
and attention. The theatre of Dionysus is too
severely classical in the beauty with which it represents
life in action, and he never learns to sit out a
pure tragedy, hear "sweetest Shakespeare warble
his native wood-notes wild," or dilate on the right
emotions, if "Jonson's learn&eacute;d sock be on."</p>

<p>The boy's talents are in all probability not at
fault. They are merely dressed in the prevailing
fashion. This fashion is set by a standard of what
is useful for material success in life. The subject-matter
of education must be scientific facts, and with
these facts the boy must be taught to reason. The
uselessness of imagination and memory as mental
powers is held up to him. It is not for him to enrich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
his mind by what an active and retentive memory
can give him of classic literature. In fact, the
memory is looked upon, by the "scientific gent"
(as Thackeray labelled him) in his laboratory, as a
minor concern and left to work out its own salvation&mdash;if
it really needs to be saved. And as for
the memory being used to chronicle the exploits of
mythical heroes in an age of superstition, that would
be unthinkable in the day of scientific research. Let
not the boy then be held up to blame if he is no more
able to name the Olympian council than was Tom
Sawyer to name the first two disciples chosen. The
fault is with the system, the rational scientific
system.</p>

<p>Greek is well nigh gone from the high school course.
Latin is under indictment. In their stead we are
to have such substitutes as biology and chemistry.
The exploits of Achilles and the wanderings of &AElig;neas
are to be supplanted by the dissection of an oyster
and the making of soap. Now oysters and soap are
all right in their way, and it is a good thing we have
the one to eat and the other to wash with; but when
it comes to using them to satisfy the instinct for a
fight or for the discovery of a hidden treasure, that is
a stupid and brutal forcing of a theory. If progress
must come at the price of selling a boy's birthright
for a mess of pottage, it is a pity some one cannot
smite her with the edge of a sword. The study of
the humanities that has been the bone and sinew of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
generations past cannot give place to the scientific
vogue without wrecking the hope and desire of many
a romantic youth. To leave out the classics is to
proclaim a material age to be bigoted, boastful,
and self-sufficient. Yet that is exactly what the
scientific educator, who calls himself modern and
progressive, is proposing, because business demands
it. What claim has a business demand on academic
policy, anyhow? Is not vagabondia as much entitled
to the floor?</p>

<p>"The descent to Avernus is easy." Reformed
spelling is not so hard as Greek roots. In fact, the
plan is to follow along the line of least resistance.
The memory must not be cumbered with dead matter
if the boy can reason on experiments for practical
business demands. And are not the myths of these
Greek and Latin languages too imaginative and
impractical, covered with too much of academic
dust, to serve a purpose in a practical age? This is
heralded from educational convention to educational
convention, and whilst the breaking of idols goes
merrily on, a few brave teachers who speak Greek
are regularly taking a Spartan stand to preserve
what yet remains of the classic structure. In a
boastful age they are not going to forget. If Homer
and Ovid are forced by business demands from the
academic halls, what hope is there left in Israel?</p>

<p>The one and only one seems to be the myths in
translation. Their claim to the attention of teachers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
can be clearly given from the preface to the best
telling of them that has yet appeared, Bulfinch's
"Age of Fable; or, Beauties of Mythology," a happy
title to such a valuable book: "If no other knowledge
deserves to be called useful but that which helps
to enlarge our possessions or to raise our station in
society, then Mythology has no claims to the appellation.
But if that which tends to make us happier
and better can be called useful, then we claim that
epithet for our subject; for Mythology is the handmaid
of literature, and literature is one of the best
allies of virtue and promoters of happiness.</p>

<p>"Without a knowledge of mythology much of
the elegant literature of our own language cannot
be understood and appreciated. When Byron calls
Rome 'the Niobe of nations,' or says of Venice, 'she
looks a Sea-Cybele fresh from ocean,' he calls up to
the mind of one familiar with our subject illustrations
more vivid and striking than the pencil could
furnish, but which are lost to the reader ignorant of
mythology. Milton abounds in similar allusions.
The short poem 'Comus' contains more than thirty
such, and the ode 'On the Morning of the Nativity'
half as many. Through 'Paradise Lost' they are
scattered profusely. This is one reason why we often
hear people say that they cannot enjoy Milton.
But were these persons to add to their solid acquirements
the easy learning of this little volume, much
of the poetry of Milton which has appeared to them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
'harsh and crabbed' would be found 'musical as
is Apollo's lute.'"</p>

<p>The truth of this last statement is very evident
to the English teacher in high school work. He
must stop to teach myths that should be the common
possession of all children before he can go on with
his work in the "Minor Poems." If boys would
enter the high school with some of the classic myths
firmly drilled into them, they would read with pleasure
the most imaginative of all the English poets.
Mythology in translation is a fixed possession of
English literature, and it must be grasped more or
less in detail before the boy can ever expect to have
the marks of literary culture and to read figurative
composition with ease. With the beginning of school
life must begin the learning of myths by word of
mouth. No classical dictionary can later take the
place of this practice. These myths are to be
mastered and reproduced in good English; and after
a few years of such drill the children will read the
stories of gods and heroes with the same ease that
they do a colloquial fairy tale. It is the same old
step from the story-teller to the book and a quiet
corner where no one can break the spell.</p>

<p>Fortunately there is not so extensive a field of
mythology suitable for use as there is of fairy literature,
and the boy can easily hope to make it his
own. The field must exclude both the modern nature
myths that have been compounded to suit the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
occasion, and the cruder and more recent discoveries
of savage races. In short, Greek mythology
must make both the beginning and the end of
what is to be learned; for there has been no nation
other than Greece that has developed a mythical
faith so intellectual in its scope and so beautiful
in its expression. This beauty has been expressed
through both art and literature. It would be an
almost unpardonable neglect on the part of a teacher
if a boy were permitted to go through school and
not be familiar with the heroic age. He should
know the stories of the gods and heroes; know the
Olympian council, the labours of Hercules, the
adventures of Jason, of Perseus, of Achilles; he
should know the Trojan War in its picturesque greatness
and the wonderful exploits of Odysseus on his
homeward journey; and he should know such stories
as those of Apollo, of &OElig;dipus, of Orpheus, of Admetus,
of Proserpine, of Niobe, and of Psyche.
This knowledge of Greek mythology will bring one
of the most pleasurable and stimulating of all feelings
to a boy, the consciousness of wandering at
ease in a domain where all mortals have not been
privileged to enter.</p>

<p>Almost hand in hand with the Greek myths must
be taken their variations in Roman life and the few
that seem to be original there. Although the Greek
and Roman deities had most attributes in common,
they were yet distinct, each having his particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
name. It is unfortunate that the Latin names have
come into such extensive use and that we always
speak of Jupiter instead of Zeus, and Venus instead
of Aphrodite. But the Hellenic spirit is hard to
keep foremost in this commercial age. If the glare
of the arc light could be screened at times and the
starry sky be read as a book wherein the constellations
still hold their Greek names, some of the
heroes that have been made permanent might inspire
the observer with a feeling to read again their story.
Yet let us have the sweetness of the rose, whatever
be its name.</p>

<p>It is rather perplexing to know what myths to
give the child when he first enters school and through
the first four or five years of his school life. The
taste and culture of the teacher have much to do with
this. But whatever is given, give it as it is written
without deforming it by having it adapted to suit
the years of the boy. He can understand many
things of which the teacher is not aware. Take it
directly from "The Age of Fable," and at the start
remove all difficulties of telling by drilling on the
pronunciation of proper names. Then let the boy
learn the myth through the ear and tell it fluently
and exactly. While doing this, the art that is so
closely woven with Greek myths must become familiar
also. The boy must be able to recognize such
works as "Aphrodite of Melos," "Apollo of the
Belvidere," "Diana of Versailles," "The Faun of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Praxiteles," "The Laoco&ouml;n Group," and "Nik&eacute; of
Samothrace." The refining influence that comes
through them is not easy to explain, but it comes.
Take it for what it is worth, as you take the myths
themselves. And at no time should the teacher
seek for philosophical arrangement and interpretation,
that at best is merely a confusion of words, or
moralize on something that is purely dramatic instead
of didactic. The myths are stories and should
be used as stories.</p>

<p>A reasonably good list to use for this kind of drill
work in, say the first four grades, is the following,
to be learned in the order written: "Latona and the
Frogs," "Arachne," "Niobe," "Midas and the
Golden Touch," "Apollo and Daphne," "Pandora
and her Box." "Narcissus," "Ceres and Proserpine,"
"Ulysses and Polyphemus," "D&aelig;dalus,"
"&AElig;olus," "Philemon," "Vulcan," "Cyparissus and
the Stag," "Arion," "Ulysses and the Sirens,"
"Callisto and Areas," "Ariadne's Thread." "Io
and the Gadfly," "Perseus and Medusa," "The
Wooden Horse," "Phaeton," "Pygmalion and
Galatea," "&AElig;sculapius and Apollo," "Jason and
the Golden Fleece," "The Death of Hector," "Cupid
and Psyche," "Ulysses and Penelope," "Pegasus,"
"Orpheus and Eurydice," "The Labors of Hercules,"
"Admetus and Alcestis." After mastering these
stories, the boy will be ready to read for himself.</p>

<p>Let him first read Hawthorne's "The Wonder-Book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
for Girls and Boys," and then the companion
volume, "Tanglewood Tales for Girls and Boys;
a Second Wonder-Book." These are indispensable.
Then he must read a good edition of Kingsley's
"Heroes; or, Greek Fairy Tales for My Children."
That is a delightful book, despite its deplorable tendency
to preach. Now he is ready for that charming
continuous tale, Lamb's "Adventures of Ulysses,"
which of course he must own and keep near at
hand. He can now take up and learn the second
most valuable work he can own as a student of
literature, Bulfinch's "Age of Fable." Of course it
is understood that Palgrave's "Golden Treasury"
is to be the first most valuable one.</p>

<p>Some dozen years ago there appeared in a magazine
a story called "The Little Brother of the Books."
It was the story of a small crippled boy who each
afternoon went his way to a certain book stall and
was always found absorbed in the same book. The
book was the "Age of Fable." That he did this
is not strange to any one who owns the book and
knows it well. There are few compilations in which
the richness of a literature is gathered together and
retold in a way that will make it endure as a book.
Yet this is true of the "Age of Fable." Every student
should own an illustrated copy of it, and preferably
one that has never been edited. It is told
as a story, and a captivating story it is. A quotation
from the preface cannot be resisted here:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
"Our book is not for the learned, nor for the theologian,
nor for the philosopher, but for the reader of
English literature, of either sex, who wishes to comprehend
the allusions so frequently made by public
speakers, lecturers, essayists, and poets, and those
which occur in polite conversation.</p>

<p>"We trust our young readers will find it a source
of entertainment; those more advanced, a useful
companion in their reading; those who travel, and
visit museums and galleries of art, an interpreter of
paintings and sculptures; those who mingle in cultivated
society, a key to allusions which are occasionally
made; and, last of all, those in advanced life,
pleasure in retracing a path of literature which leads
them back to the days of their childhood, and revives
at every step the associations of the morning of life.</p>

<p>"The permanency of these associations is beautifully
expressed in the well-known lines of Coleridge:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>BOOKS TO BE OWNED, TO BE READ, AND TO BE REREAD</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The first time I read an excellent book, it is to me just as if I had
gained a new friend. When I read a book I have perused before, it
resembles the meeting with an old one."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Goldsmith.</span></p><br /></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> how far books and reading are questions of
taste, or should be looked on as questions of taste
merely, is passing hard to say. That there are prevailing
fashions, local-colour variations, and a few
more or less permanent models is noticeable to such
a degree that an observer might conclude motley
to be the only wear. The readers seem to be no
more able to agree in what they like than did the
urchins over the pease-porridge in the nursery
rhyme:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Some like it hot,<br />
Some like it cold,<br />
Some like it in the pot<br />
Nine days old.<br />
</div>

<p>So it goes in books with every one to his own
liking, though the particular likings are a very unsubstantial
guide to the literary merits of the books
liked. A book may become a fashion based on conventional
acquiescence and appearances rather than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
on real worth. Let the judgment of individualism,
with courage and restraint, lay bare the fashion,
and where then is its habitation or what is its name?
Such judgment sets up more or less arbitrary lines
of taste that run wide, and it makes a guess at what
is enduring literature, a hazardous kind of guess.
Yet the peculiar thing of it all is that in this guess
pedantry is as likely to play false as is the capricious
fancy of the reading public that takes the
book of the hour, whatever it be. This makes a
kind of self-constituted division of readers, each
satisfied with his lot and each serving a purpose.</p>

<p>Some readers' tastes, however, are neither prudish
nor slovenly. They are very catholic and succeed
in picking out what is good from both the bookish
and the popular kinds of books. They can read
any book that is a book. But you recall that
Charles Lamb could not reckon directories, scientific
treatises, the works of Hume and Gibbon, and
generally those "volumes which no gentleman's
library should be without" as being books. If to
these were added those books which no gentleman's
library should contain, we come to a field fairly easy
of investigation. In other words, we must get back
to that field that includes the literature of power
rather than the literature of knowledge. Of course,
if somebody chooses to read blockheaded encyclop&aelig;dias,
withering economic essays, proper Sunday
school books, sophomoric novels, or privately printed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
verse, that is purely his own concern; but such
reading is beyond the pale of real books as they
relate to well-regulated courses in the home or in
school life.</p>

<p>How far is a teacher to be influenced in his selection
of books for students by their lines of taste?
That depends on how far the tastes of readers in
general indicate that books of their liking are to be
classed as books of power, as real literature. It is
rash to say that a book has real merit because it
becomes the best seller of a season; nor is it to be
condemned for the very reason that it is a best
seller. However, the general praise of a hundred
thousand readers is not so much an index to the
book's merit as the book is an index to the character
of the readers who praise it. Unqualified laudation
of a new book, especially a novel, is an annoying
kind of hysteria that has failed to find any other
outlet. But the very fact that the book is opportune
or spectacular carries it along. It grows up
and flourishes in a day, and in a day dies out.</p>

<p>It is curious to note how times change in the reading
world and with them lines of taste. To-day
the line most evident in the American reading public,
and the one most difficult to meet in the development
of a taste for good books, is the passion to be
up-to-date, as its commercial phraseology would
have it. It is awakened by that wonderful agent,
the advertising appeal, that deals not with quality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
but with quantity. In books it calls for a story,
and that story must be the latest or it is certain to
be absolutely neglected. On being asked what dish
he preferred at a dinner, Thoreau said, "The
nearest." That was in keeping with his theory of
cutting down the denominator; the theory of the
reader of the latest is one of multiplying the numerator.
As the proper thing, each new book is taken,
horns, hide, and tallow. The reader's reverence for
the present grows apace, and he no longer has use
for old wine, old friends, and old books. This is a
reflection of a widespread impression in American
life that up to the present time but little truth of
substantial value as to methods of living and thinking
has been found out. A wonderful industrial
progress, working through inventive skill, has given
the notion that anything over a generation old is
scarcely worth a passing notice, a notion fatal to all
art. Every one must seize in a hurry the newest
thing in the market, lest he be branded as out of
date. And it all looks as if everybody was trying
to do what Alice found them trying to do in Wonderland,
running as fast as they could to keep where
they were.</p>

<p>This mad rush for the latest is largely aided and
abetted by that invention of the devil, the literary
section of many Sunday newspapers. Finding research
a bit dull, the ambitious or needy doctor of
philosophy launches into literary criticism for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
reading public. He at once discovers that the college
sophomore who wrote a particular story is
another Thackeray in style. Then in turn a Dickens
or a Balzac is found out. Finally the news is passed
on the Rialto that there is being issued a story combining
the delightful characteristics of the three old
masters. And thus and thus it goes, with the whirligig
of Sunday newspaper criticism spinning out the
tastes of the reading public.</p>

<p>Now if these titled critics ever cease discovering
great new books as regularly as the day of rest comes
around, or if the paper reading public cease to take
these critics as truthful, then the teacher may hope
to find a more sympathetic field in which to work.
Of course the teacher must shake off his pedantry
and quit his foolishness in taking a classic beyond
the years of the boy whose veins are full of red
blood, and putting it on a dissecting table for the
study of etymology and syntax. He must know
fairly well the boy's likes and dislikes and remember
that they are very strong. And he must also remember
that the boy is joined to his idols, and these are
not to be broken until better ones are substituted.
Iconoclasm for its own sake is sheer waste. The
teacher himself must be wedded to good literature,
or his efforts will avail little. If he knows, from
his own quiet reading, a few good books well, that
is enough. Sympathetic appreciation, like good
nature, is contagious. If the teacher does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
appreciate the book, the boy will not&mdash;unless he
does it out of pardonable perversity.</p>

<p>The teacher has more to do with shaping the boy's
reading than he at first sees. He is apt to hesitate
because the public library, ambitious for a circulation
record, gives the boy what he will be likely to
read; the Sunday school library, anxious to inculcate
moral principles through stories false to life,
gives him what he does not want; the home, eager
to please him in every way, gives him anything he
asks for. Yet in the face of this threefold condition,
the wise and sympathetic teacher can direct
an average course of reading that has in it more
good than poor books. To do this, he must work
along two lines: discourage overreading and encourage
ownership in books. The practice of overreading
is the worst reading practice in modern life.
Like all extremism, it is hard to meet. It is as unpopular
to oppose unlimited reading as it is to oppose
unlimited charity or unlimited education; yet
they all need to be carried out in moderation. The
aim should be the mastery of a few good books and
the discouragement of the passion for constant variety
that indicates a lack of singleness of purpose
through a lack of self-control and the power of sustained
attention. The greatest aid to this will be
the encouragement of small savings and the buying
of good editions. When this is done, encourage the
boy to read out loud to his family at home in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
evenings the portions of his book he likes best. If
he does this, he and his book are friends as long as
he continues reading. Soon he will have a small,
well-chosen, and much-used library. The boy who
will buy a book with his own money, will read aloud
from it to his family, will reread it, is safely started
on the way to becoming a well-read man.</p>

<p>After feeling the need of good books in the home
where they can be turned to as the fancy directs,
and after feeling a desire to buy such books, the
boy will next need to know what titles to select.
And that is no easy question. Temperament, home
circumstances, occupation, and many other factors
enter into it. But the thing that helps out is the
fact that the range of books of power is universal,
embracing so many moods, that enough good titles
may be found for any one, however whimsical
his tastes may be. In fact the boy will find many
more good books to his liking than he will ever find
time to read, or than he needs to read. The problem
will become one of exclusion. Two lists for two
boys of different dispositions may vary widely and
yet both be good literature. But in the range of
English books there are a few that the common
judgment of readers and the praise of critics have
so generally classed as necessary to the shelves of a
cultivated man, that they should be given first place
and in some way or other a reading and a rereading
of them be secured. It is not meant that reading is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
never to depart from this seemingly arbitrary standard.
That would be at least prudish, to say nothing
of its being impracticable. What is meant is
that such things as comic supplements, at once
stupid, silly, and debauching to both the intellectual
and the artistic tastes, should be kept from all boys.
The daily newspaper with its sensational head-lines
telling of crimes is as bad, and the schoolboy has
no business with it at all. But maybe the practice
most widespread and fatal to an appreciation
of books of real worth and power is the addiction to
"juveniles" in the ever issuing series. If he has
drunk to excess of these, the boy will have hopelessly
weakened his ability ever to appreciate anything
great. He will never be able to warm to the powerful
deeds of Odysseus, Hector, or Joshua&mdash;he will
be only a tolerable but proper grown-up. In the
face of these and many more hindrances, reading
will have to be rigidly directed, and in that directing,
lines of appeal in the field of good literature can be
drawn out. Generally the reason for a boy's revolting
against a good book is the fact that whoever is
in control of his reading presupposes that very thing.
The book is often timidly handed out and with
something of an apologetic air. By some peculiar
piece of judgment it is believed that the boy prefers
the book that is both insipid and stupid. This
ineffectual effort arises from a lack of courage on the
part of preceptor and parent: the old, old story of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
overindulgence. What may be sauce for the
father should not always be sauce for the son. The
theory that what is good for the one ought to be good
for the other, even to food and drink, is only another
sophism of a falsely sentimental age that is over-tolerant
of what is called personal rights. The fact
that Senator Hoar delighted in an occasional yellow
back, is no reason why a boy should have such a
story when he should be learning his catechism.</p>

<p>Before venturing on a list of books that will serve
the boy fairly well as he passes through the primary
and the grammar grades of school, a few of the
superior books that have stood the test of time must
be noticed. They are fundamental in school and in
general reading. The arguments of literary critics
as to what constitutes this good literature have no
place in a work of this nature that aims to aid teachers
and parents in selecting books for their children.
It is enough to know that the verdict of time
has been rendered in favour of such books as "The
Arabian Nights' Entertainments," "Robinson
Crusoe," and "Gulliver's Travels." A knowledge
of such books is fundamental to any one who is
ambitious to master the elements of English literature.
And the mere fact that he knows them well
will give him a conscious strength and pardonable
feeling of superiority that the unlettered youth cannot
have. After this he can be trusted to browse
pretty much as he chooses. He may occasionally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
find the bars down, or maybe later go over the
fences; but he has learned to judge of what is
worth while, and will surely return to the books that
gave him happy hours, whatever other tasks were
laid on him.</p>

<p>In selecting this list for schoolboys there is a
temptation to take works too mature for school age.
This may come from that lingering instinct that
supposes every one, no matter what the age, to be
interested in the same things in which you are interested.
The very best things for manhood are to
be reserved for that time of life. Grammar school
boys cannot appreciate the playful humour of Lamb,
the prophetic scolding of Carlyle, or Thackeray's
keen analysis of human weaknesses and foibles;
neither can a high school boy do it, and it is foolish
to insist that it be done. Schoolboys are not men,
and they might be told to reserve the greater
part of Carlyle and Thackeray until two or three
years after they have cast their first vote. Neither
author is adapted to a beardless youth. But then
we have that wonderful pair of story-tellers, Scott
and Stevenson! What boy can resist them or would
ever think of trying to do so? If Margaret Ogilvy
would not lay down a book of "that Stevenson man"
until she had found out how the laddie got out of
the barrel, do you suppose that a boy with adventurous
blood in his veins could do so? Though the
best test for a child's book is the fact that it has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
charms for the grown-up, he would certainly be
foolish who would insist that the great books for
mature men and women be read in youth. It is
after all school days are ended and the boy has become
a man well started in the actual affairs of life
that he can read and appreciate "Vanity Fair,"
"Adam Bede," "Tess of the D'Urbervilles," or
"Anna Kar&eacute;nina." The tendency to take great
books for mature readers, abridge and overedit
them, and then present them to adventurous boys
by a laboratory method of minute dissection, is
annoying and foolish. Boys who still enjoy harnessing
a dog to a wagon are neither university
students nor good literary critics. But they do like
to find out how Robinson Crusoe made a canoe,
Tom Canty ate his first royal dinner, or David Balfour
helped Alan Breck defend the roundhouse.</p>

<p>Naturally, the first book to put into the hands of
the primary school child to be called his own is a
good illustrated edition of the Mother Goose rhymes.
There is nothing to take the place of that accumulated
wisdom of the nursery that is so charming to
the ear. He has learned many of the jingles by word
of mouth before his school age; but he now needs
to own the book himself, read the words, and look
at the pictures. The whole thing must be in one
volume for him. But what volume? It is hardly
safe to presuppose the possession of these nursery
rhyme books before the school age, though that is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
exactly where they belong. Maybe for this reason
it is better to start with the edition of Kate Greenaway
that makes up in refinement and delicacy for
what it lacks in power and intensity. It is unfortunate
that there is no available reprint of the original
edition of "Mother Goose's Melody" compiled
by Oliver Goldsmith for John Newbery about 1765,
which contained the "most celebrated songs and
lullabies of the old British nurses, calculated to
amuse children and incite them to sleep." To own
such a quaint edition would surely be a delight.
Nearly as quaint and delightful, especially the
illustrations, is the "Only True Mother Goose
Melodies" now reprinted from the Boston edition
of 1839. Of the editions of recent years there are
many good ones, the one appearing under the title
of "National Rhymes of the Nursery" having superior
illustrations by Leslie Brooke, but being marred
by an artificial arrangement. If some artist with
the genius of Cruikshank would give a few of the
best years of his life to illustrating a complete collection
of these rhymes, he would become a benefactor
of childhood. And if such an edition were
well made mechanically, printed on good unglazed
linen paper from large type and good woodcuts,
well sewed, and bound in linen or leather, the boy
might consider himself favoured of the gods if he could
call such a book his own. These "things that are
old and pretty" deserve to be well arrayed. Yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
they deserve to be read for their own sake, an enduring
charm of sound. Professor Saintsbury has
clearly pointed out that they should never be twisted
into an authentic meaning according to the spirit
of severest "scientism"; but they should be made
"to serve as anthems and doxologies to the goddess
whom in this context it is not satirical to call 'Divine
Nonsensia,' who still in all lands and times condescends
now and then to unbind the burden of meaning
from the backs and brains of men, and lets
them rejoice once more in pure, natural, senseless
sound."</p>

<p>After the nursery rhymes, the next volumes for
the boy's book shelf will be collections of fables
and fairy tales. The animal fable is easiest to start
with, and children like it best as a rule. Talking
beasts kindle their imagination and stimulate their
awakening powers. Fables are direct, simple, wise,
and have a universal appeal. In the delightful first
chapter of "The Newcomes," Thackeray tells us
that long ages before &AElig;sop, asses under lions' manes
roared in Hebrew, sly foxes flattered in Etruscan,
and wolves in sheep's clothing gnashed their teeth
in Sanscrit. They are a common inheritance for
childhood. The English-speaking child has a number
of very good collections at his command, among
them being the one recently issued with illustrations
by Arthur Rackham and another in the New Cranford
series illustrated by Richard Heighway, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
should surely own the one or the other. But in
neither is the drawing quite so charming as is that
of Boutet de Monvel for the French fables of La
Fontaine.</p>

<p>What a pity that there is no single volume of fairy
tales to meet the child's demands! It should contain
the best of the English folk tales, the best of
Perrault, the brothers Grimm, Andersen, and others;
should have illustrations of the merit of Cruikshank's;
should be artistically printed and bound&mdash;and it
should be a big book. Children love big books.
A child's book on thin paper and bound in limp
leather would not be a child's book. Coloured illustrations
are not necessary; children like a few lines
in black and white; but it is necessary to have the
book a kind of "ponderous tome." Then it can be
read on the floor while it rests on the boy's knees as
he sits cross-legged before the fire; or, better still,
while he lies on his belly, his chin in his hands and
his feet swaying in the air. While he is small, no
real boy was ever designed to sit upright on a chair
and hold a small book ten inches from his eyes,
with the light coming over his left shoulder. Maybe
some philanthropic publisher will some day issue a
big book of tales to be owned by the boy and read
at his ease. But the lack of it to-day necessitates
the building up of a fairy library.</p>

<p>The first book to be put into the fairy library
might be the charming "Golden Goose Book" of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Leslie Brooke, followed by Cruikshank's "Fairy
Book." The Mother Goose tales as first collected
by Perrault should now be owned in a well-illustrated
English translation. On account of their
humour and their common everyday tone, the English
household and folk tales will make a strong
appeal. Scudder's "Folk Stories," S. Baring-Gould's
"Old English Fairy Tales," and "Fairy-Gold" by
Ernest Rhys are all good in their way; but "English
Fairy Tales" by Joseph Jacobs, with its amusing
illustrations by John Batton, is told in the
simplest and most dramatic way, and it should be
owned by every boy.</p>

<p>There is one collection of fairy tales that should
come into the boy's possession about the end of the
third school year, and that book is the excellent work
of the brothers Grimm, whatever be the title. The
one superior translation is the one made by Edward
Taylor about 1826, and a reprint of it issued in 1878,
with Cruikshank's etchings and Ruskin's introduction.
But there are many good and simple translations
that are well illustrated. After these highly
imaginative tales of the German fireside, there should
be owned a good translation of the romantic and
refined tales of the North, the fairy tales of Hans
Christian Andersen. To these stories are many
excellent illustrations, including those of Stratton,
Tegner, and Dulac. It may not be possible and
maybe not desirable to own editions of the tales of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
D'Aulnoy, Laboulaye, Hauff, and others, for the
best of their stories may be found in some compilations.
Among these are "Mother Goose Nursery
Tales" issued by Nister, Andrew Lang's "Blue Fairy
Book," "Big Book of Fairy Tales" collected by
Walter Jerrold, "A Child's Book of Stories" illustrated
by Jessie Wilcox Smith and the recently issued
attractive edition of "The Fairy Book" by
Dinah Maria Mulock. A distinct service could have
been rendered to children if Andrew Lang had selected
the best of the stories from his voluminous and
unequally good colour fairy books and had issued
them in one large, well-made volume with artistic
illustrations.</p>

<p>And yet there remains the greatest and most
wonderful of all fairy tales, the "Tales of a Thousand
and One Nights," to be begun with the easier tales
now, but only to be enjoyed thoroughly in the upper
grammar grades. No other book is so romantic or
so entrancing, nor does anybody ever get too old
to read it. It worked its spell on Coleridge, for
he wrote: "Give me the 'Arabian Nights' Entertainments'
which I used to watch, till the sun shining
on the bookcase appeared, and, glowing full
upon it, gave me the courage to take it from the
shelf." And was it not this book that made wonderful
little Marjorie Fleming willing to sleep at the
foot of the bed where she could continually read it?
The translation made by Edward William Lane in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
1839 and illustrated by William Harvey under his
direction will never be surpassed; but Jonathan
Scott's translation is easier for the boy to read.
Many well-illustrated but not always well-edited
editions may be found.</p>

<p>Will a boy read "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"?
Should a boy read "Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland"? Yes and yes! Any boy who
cannot enjoy the most delightful fooling that was
ever put into a book deserves the greatest of sympathy.
He is certainly full of unmannerly sadness
in his youth. Where else was there ever such clever
and curious nonsense? What mathematician other
than Dodgson ever put before boys and girls such
enduring work? It is a case where two and two does
not always make four, but it does always make the
pleasing thing. Much that goes as serious literature
is not half so wise as is the playfulness of this book,
nor is it so worthy of being thoroughly known and
appreciated. Of course there are a few perpendicular
people who see not that it has abiding charms.
They cannot double or shake to the mood of its
nonsense&mdash;nor do they find it grow "curiouser
and curiouser" with each reading. Yet it is a classic
for children, and it is going to endure.</p>

<p>As a general rule, books for children are cast in a
rather serious mood. This is true of the myth and
the romantic fairy tale. But the element of humour
creeps into the English and the German household<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
tales, for humour is necessary to all earnest living.
How far this sense of humour is to be developed is a
question hard to answer. This much is true, however:
in mature years and under the full responsibility
of life, a keen sense of humour is about the only
thing that will save a man from himself at times,
preserve his balance when he is nearing the borderland
of tragedy. Now what is to be the nature of
this humour? Is it to be the insipid burlesque that
finds its pleasure in the medical almanac and the
comic supplement? Or is it to be the kind that
wears the sock with brains and taste, the kind that
Touchstone has? The latter is the one that sparkles
and is worth while. It is the kind that the child
starts with in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"
and "The Rose and the Ring." It is the product of
men who possess qualities of mind and heart such
as Thackeray did. How Shakespeare must have
doted on his jesters! And what musical nonsense
refrains he wrote.</p>

<p>All this bears out De Quincey's saying that only
a man of extraordinary talent can write nonsense.
And nonsense literature is a test of the ability of
a reader. Pitt once exclaimed: "Don't tell me of
a man's being able to talk sense; every one can talk
sense. Can he talk nonsense?" Now a child will
talk nonsense and delight in it, even if it is nothing
but a counting-out rhyme. Then he will come to prefer
nonsense of a refined type, innocent and fantastic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
verse. A book of this kind that he will take a fancy
to is Edward Lear's "Nonsense Songs"; and if it
is the edition illustrated by Leslie Brooke, he will be
grateful when a nonsense mood is on him. Ruskin
called it the most beneficent and innocent of all
nonsense books. The boy might start with this
book, go to "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"
and then try "The Rose and the Ring." When he
reaches the upper grammar grades, he will then
enjoy the splendid retelling of "The Adventures
of Don Quixote," by Judge Parry, with Walter
Crane's illustrations. If he does this, on reaching
man's estate he will keep some favourite translation
of this wonderful book of Cervantes in a convenient
pocket edition along with his "Pickwick
Papers."</p>

<p>Before going to the class of books based on myths,
one brief work must be mentioned, not only because
it marks an epoch in the making of children's books,
but also because it is a child's classic with real
merit, and about the only one on such a theme.
Nearly all others of this kind are prudish, priggish,
and inartistic. This one happens to have a loftiness
of tone. Its style is as charming as this whimsical
title: "The History of Little Goody Two Shoes,
otherwise called Mrs. Marjory Two Shoes, the means
by which she acquired her learning and wisdom,
and in consequence thereof her estate; set forth at
large for the benefit of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"Who from a state of Rags and Care,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And having Shoes but half a Pair;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Their Fortune and their Fame would fix,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And gallop in a Coach and Six."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>If any one is in doubt as to who wrote this book,
the inscription "to all young gentlemen and ladies
who are good, or intend to be good" ought to convince
him. Intend to be good, was not that Goldsmith&mdash;and
the rest of us? An edition of this
historic story with pictures after the original woodcuts
of 1765 should be in the hands of every child.</div>

<p>Though America's contribution to children's literature
of an enduring type has been limited, it is
gratifying to know that America's most finished
artist, Nathaniel Hawthorne, has given to that
literature two books that every boy must know,
"Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys" and "Tanglewood
Tales for Girls and Boys; a Second Wonder-Book."
That every boy who is going to become a
mature reader of good books needs to know the
myths of Greece and Rome, goes without saying.
Now he had better learn these from a book having
a literary touch than from the ordinary telling of
text-books. For this reason he should completely
master these two books by Hawthorne. The illustrated
edition of the former by Walter Crane and
George Wharton Edwards' illustrations of the latter
are both fine. Not so good as these two, yet necessary,
is Charles Kingsley's "Heroes; or, Greek<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Fairy Tales for My Children." And the telling of
the story of the Odyssey by Charles Lamb in his
"Adventures of Ulysses" is good to read, but rather
difficult before the last year of the grammar grades.
The wonderful exploits of the heroes in the Iliad
should be familiar to every boy, and he can get them
about all in Bulfinch's "Age of Fable" as well as
anywhere else. This book he must surely own,
and whether it is called merely a text-book or not, it
is the best work that has yet appeared on the mythology
of the world as it is found in classical allusions
of English books. If he learns the story of
the siege of Troy and the return to Ithaca from this
book, he may want to hear Chapman speak out loud
and bold a few years later.</p>

<p>Does any schoolboy from a home other than one
in which Puritan notions yet prevail read "Pilgrim's
Progress"? If he does not, the fault is not in the
book. It is as interesting as it is vitally true, and has
been positively helpful. According to Macaulay, it
has been loved by those too simple to admire it.
There is really no such thing as an uninteresting
great book. There are uninterested people, though
there should not be an uninterested normal boy.
If there is, he is a victim of the emasculating process
of sugar-coated teaching, parental indulgence, and
vaudeville amusement. Or maybe he has the habit
of the boy's series, that cuts all characters to the
same fashion, the fashion of prudery. In either case he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
will never be a pilgrim. Of course it would be foolish
to insist on a boy's reading many such books, even
if there were more like it written. You might as
well insist on seven sermons a week for a man. One
in seven days seems often enough to be effective;
and one great book like this one, if well mastered, is
all that the boy needs. In mature years he can again
read it and marvel at its intrinsic greatness and find
it something of a reflection of his own experiences in
life. And by having done this he may chance to
read such great poetical allegories as the "Faerie
Queene" and the "Divine Comedy."</p>

<p>As this allegory of Bunyan's represented the
spiritual experiences of life as the Puritan saw it,
so does "Robinson Crusoe" represent the Puritan
view of the practical virtues in experience, such as
the virtues of prudence, ingenuity, and patience.
But for all this it is one of the most fascinating and
typical of English stories, and one of the really great
ones. Every lad must know this book. Stevenson
tells of a Welsh blacksmith who learned to read that
he might add this hero to his possibilities of experience.</p>

<p>The third book of that great half-century following
the Restoration is one of the few books written
to be read by men that has become a child's classic.
No wonder Swift afterwards exclaimed, "What a
genius I had when I wrote that book!" Yet children
read it with pleasure without seeing anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
in it but the interesting adventures of Gulliver.
Of course, the voyages to Lilliput and to Brobdingnag
are the only ones to be given to the boy, and it is
unfortunate that publishers have not generally recognized
this in issuing "Gulliver's Travels" for
children. It is less necessary to read the other
two voyages than it is to read the second part of
"Pilgrim's Progress" and the "Further Adventures
of Robinson Crusoe."</p>

<p>There is a field of reading very much akin to the
field of mythology in which there is no single book
that the boy can read that is so permanent in its
form as is the "Wonder-Book," yet it is a field in
which the boy should feel at home. That is the field
that includes the Arthurian legends and the Robin
Hood stories. Among the many books that have
appeared, the excellent work done by the poet Lanier
in his "Boy's King Arthur" and by the late artist
Howard Pyle should surely find a place on every boy's
book shelf. Much of Malory is retained in the former,
and the conventional drawings in the latter
make a strong appeal despite the widespread mania
for colour. The boy who has become attached to
his "Age of Fable" might satisfy his curiosity in
this romantic field by the almost equally good "Age
of Chivalry" and "The Legends of Charlemagne."</p>

<p>At what age should a boy turn to Shakespeare?
That depends on the boy. If he is an average child,
he should have something of the plays read to him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
at a fairly young age; but it is doubtful if he can do
much on his own account before the high school age
is reached. He might, however, be urged to attempt
"A Midsummer-Night's Dream," "The Tempest,"
and "King Henry V." At about the age of twelve
or fourteen years he should own a good illustrated
edition in one volume such as the one done by Sir
John Gilbert. But be this as it may, he has a right
to get something of a glimpse of the wonderful things
in these plays through that admirable telling of some
of them in Lamb's "Tales from Shakespeare."
Though it may be Lamb instead of Shakespeare,
there is no better book of retold stones in English
than this work of Thackeray's "Dear Saint Charles"
and his sister Mary.</p>

<p>This brings up the question of the boy's reading
of poetry and the books that he should own. As
suggested in a former chapter, the one good collection
is Palgrave's "Children's Treasury of English
Song." There is no second one in this class; for
all others seem to have some fatal defects of judgment,
though they are usually printed in more
attractive form. The publishers of this anthology
need to issue a well printed, well illustrated, and
well bound edition, and the book stores need to
put it on their shelves, where it is now almost a total
stranger. But the approach to such a collection
should be gradual. It might start in the second
grade with Kate Greenaway's edition of "Dame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Wiggins of Lee and Her Seven Wonderful Cats;
a Humorous Tale Written Principally by a Lady of
Ninety," and Caldecott's "John Gilpin's Ride."
This could be followed with Kate Greenaway's or
Hope Dunlap's "Pied Piper of Hamelin." And
all children must have Stevenson's "A Child's
Garden of Verses" with illustrations by either
Florence Edith Storer or Jessie Wilcox Smith.
Eugene Field's "Poems of Childhood," illustrated
by Maxfield Parrish, deserves a place, as does the
dainty volume of Blake's "Songs of Innocence,"
illustrated by Geraldine Morris. If on reaching
the upper grammar grades the boy has found pleasure
in his "Children's Treasury of English Song,"
he might be urged to own complete editions of a few
of the poets. The first volume should be the poems
of Longfellow, not because of his greatness but because
he is the best loved of our noted poets and the
easiest one for the boy to read. The next volume
should be one of Tennyson, where he will find things
actually great. If he comes to prefer "The Passing
of Arthur" to "Enoch Arden," he is developing
taste and judgment and will later enjoy Milton and
Wordsworth.</p>

<p>There are two books of recent years, "The Jungle
Book" and "The Second Jungle Book," that have
intrinsic worth and charm and should be owned by
every boy about his fifth school year. The superior
tales are the Mowgli stories, and it is a pity they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
not issued in a single volume. Where was there
ever a more intense or dramatic story written than
"Red Dog"? How does it happen that teachers
seldom give these stories to children, but manage to
waste plenty of good time on insipid, made-to-order
stories designed to teach mercy to animals? These
animal stories for a purpose are like most verse for
an occasion&mdash;an offence against literary art. Let
the boy learn of the charms and the tragedies of animal
life in the jungle.</p>

<p>When the boy's reading shifts toward the romance
and the novel, he needs to guard against overreading,
indiscriminate reading, and being bewildered
by the multitude of books from which to
choose. For a while he had better keep to such books
as "The Prince and the Pauper" and "Treasure
Island." If he is not at once interested in that plot
based on the universal desire to change lots with
some one else, or the universal longing to find a
hidden treasure, he either has perverted tastes or is
without any tastes at all. From these it is an easy
step to the forest life of "The Last of the Mohicans"
and the life of chivalry presented in "Ivanhoe."
He will then surely like that charming story of
romantic home life, "Lorna Doone."</p>

<p>Some teacher may wonder if books other than
stories and verse are not to be read. Of course they
are, and they will be anyhow. Yet they are not
books of power, fundamental to the growth of personality;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
they are books of knowledge of one kind
or another. Just where the division line is to be
drawn and which is the right class for this book and
that, is hard to say, and matters little when it is
determined; but the place of a few has been definitely
fixed by experience, and they happen to be
stories. That great literary field of comfort to
men, the personal essay, is beyond the schoolboy.
And so is much of biography and history. But there
can be found for him to read many books, such as
"Tales of a Grandfather," "A Child's History of
England," Southey's "Life of Nelson," "Two
Years Before the Mast," "The Oregon Trail,"
Franklin's "Autobiography," and some good abridgment
of "Plutarch's Lives," that make an order of
books different from "Robinson Crusoe," "Pilgrim's
Progress," and "Arabian Nights' Entertainments";
yet they ought to be read after a few of the greater
ones have been mastered. Many a boy may be
greatly helped and inspired to honest effort by
Samuel Smiles' "Self-Help," yet no one would think
of classing it as great literature. This, together
with books on travel and the wonders of science
and invention will take care of themselves, and the
average boy will pick up enough of them of his
own accord. What he needs is a book that by its
imaginative power lifts him above the commonplace
facts of everyday life. If the foundation be
laid in the enduring work of a few great books, what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
is built thereon will abundantly reward the early
effort of mastering them.</p>

<p>There is yet one book of powerful and pure English
that must be mentioned. The boy should have
early heard it read aloud, learned passages from it
by heart, and have read parts of it on his own account.
In proportion as he has gathered the richness
of this book will he have a grasp on clear language
and clear understanding. That book is the
version of the Bible authorized by King James. It
gave to our fathers not only their faith but also that
grip on racy, clear, and vigorous English that made
many an artisan a better talker and writer than the
man trained in the halls of higher learning. It has
had a power above all other books in English to stir
the imagination and move the soul, and this without
regard to any particular religious belief. No
book has ever told stories with the ease, directness,
and intensity of this one. Its style expresses the
strongest and deepest feelings of English-speaking
men. And this style has been caught by such masters
of prose in their own centuries as Bunyan and
Lincoln. Yet it is evident to teachers that the
great stories of the Scriptures are not known by
children. The Bible needs to be dusted and read,
even if it is brought about by the strong hand of
authority in the home and in the school.</p>

<p>Taste in books can be directed, or at least modified,
and the authority to direct must be about its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
business with the urchins at school. The aphorism
that you can lead a horse to the water but you cannot
make him drink, is only half true. If the water
is kept under his nose and there is a good grip on the
halter, he will be drinking before he is aware of it.
In fact, he may need to be led away at times to keep
him from drinking too much. The business of the
school teacher is to get the boy to the trough and
then see that he does not drink too much. This will
be a thing of effort, for at every turn there are the
springs of juvenile series, Sunday School Pharisees,
comic supplements, and penny-dreadfuls that flow
as if they would never cease. The boy needs to
develop a sort of anchorite spirit and seek out a
secluded place with an armful of books that are
really worth while.</p>

<p>The armful which he needs to own and be friends
with might be something like the following, if such a
list can be ventured without offence to that strong
spirit of individualism that will call it wooden and
lock-step; yet that in its iconoclasm and mental
anarchy gets nowhere and does nothing. This is
the list by grades: First grade&mdash;"Mother Goose
Rhymes," Brooke's "The Golden Goose Book,"

<p>The savings necessary to buy these books, the
time spent in reading and rereading them, the power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and taste that will come from both of these efforts,&mdash;these
will serve the boy when he comes to man's
estate. For no work in a finishing school or in college
English can ever give him what he will get of
his own accord by having good books as his companions
during his public school life. Let him try the
list with the hope that it will meet Ruskin's comment:
"Of course you must or will read other books
for amusement, once or twice; but you will find that
these have an element of perpetuity in them."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ON THE PURCHASE AND CARE OF BOOKS</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Knowing I lov'd my books, he furnish'd me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">From my own library, with volumes that</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I prize above my dukedom."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Prospero.</span></span><br />
<br /></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> publishing of books is like the brook in the
poem, it goes on forever. The number and variety
found on sale at the end of each year is truly bewildering.
The flesh is becoming wearied with the
number and the spirit perturbed with the variety.
The prospective buyer does not know where or how
to begin, and about the only way out of the confusion
is to do as the brothers did in the story, buy them
by the yard. For the man of long purse it is a convenient
way to untie the library knot; but after
this has been done the question of where to begin
reading is a harder one than where to begin buying
had been. There was much philosophy in the remark
of the quickly made <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'millionnaire'">millionaire</ins>, who after
having bought many editions de luxe of standard
authors, said: "Now give me something that I
can read, a few stories of Old Sleuth and Nick
Carter." Though his taste might be questioned,
his remark hit the nail on the head&mdash;a few books
that can be read.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>That is what the average buyer is after. And
these few must be books that are worth while, must
be taken from the multitude, and must be taken one
or two at a time if they are to be properly enjoyed.
Each season brings a few of these in new and attractive
editions. By them must the library be slowly
built up. The purchase of many volumes at a time,
even if they are good volumes, is something few
readers can stand. It is like the sudden acquisition
of wealth or the sudden coming into fame: a stumbling
block to the greatest of pleasures, the slow
but certain enrichment of life. Many a good student
has been spoiled by being turned loose in a school
library that cost him no effort or inconvenience to
acquire. Ease of access and intemperance of use
are things on which he will fall down. And therein
is the foolishness of parents in supplying their children
all at once with that great and varied load
that has several times appeared under different
names, but with the general title of libraries for
young folk. There is much good and conveniently
arranged material in all of them; but it is this very
thing of coming into the child's possession all at
once that makes them objectionable. Books, like
many other luxuries, should not be indulged in to
excess.</p>

<p>Books for the boy should largely be purchased
out of his own savings. No book bought in this
way will be left unread. Some persuasion on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
part of teachers and parents will be necessary to
bring about this practice of saving. A month or
so before Christmas or the summer vacation the
town boy ought to be told to save the money he is
used to spending on candy and picture shows that
he may buy for himself a book. The country boy
can do the same thing by hoeing corn a few more
days for a neighbour or raising a few more chickens on
his own account. As they should, books will also
come as gifts, and poor judgment on the part of the
giver is very unfortunate. The giving of a poor
book that can hardly be afforded is kind-hearted as
an act; but the boy who feels by courtesy bound
to read it is surely a helpless victim. Yet in his
own family he should be given a book twice each
year, on his birthday and at Christmas time. In
fact he needs to be taught always to celebrate the
one and hang up his stocking on the other; for no
two practices will be so likely to keep him from
falling into cynicism in mature years&mdash;especially
if each anniversary brings with it a helpful book.
Highly prized as will be these good books the boy
receives as gifts, they will never mean quite the
same to him as the books bought at a sacrifice to
himself. When all is said and done, about the best
indication of practical wisdom in this age of prodigality
is economy of savings. It will surely be
followed by economy of time and energy. The boy
who is taught to save money for the purchase of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
something of permanent value has a good start in the
right direction. The most reasonable thing to buy
with these savings is a few good books.</p>

<p>What shall the reader buy, and where shall it be
bought? To the former question a partial answer
has already been attempted, but to the latter one
the answer is more uncertain. In a general way a
book might be bought as any other article is bought,
where the same quality can be bought cheapest.
But that principle is based on the advertising appeal,
an appeal that is strong where extravagance and
wastefulness abound. The making, selling, and
buying of books is no exception to this rule of trade.
Books, like other articles, are now bought and sold
according to fashion, and the official pot of fashion
must be kept boiling if it takes the last penny. And
like other fashions book fashions change, even to
morals and heroines; so that a body might as well
be out of the reading world as to be out of fashion
in it. Just now the fashion seems to turn out books
with morbid morals and mediocre heroines, and yet
the people continue to read them and talk about them.
The story is drawn, printed, bought, read, dramatized,
heard, and praised&mdash;even from the pulpit.
And before there is time for you to compose yourself
in peace, a new emotion is sprung on which all must
dilate alike. This is the hubbub about the multitude
of new books that makes the buying of a few
standard ones something of a problem. The classics,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
especially for children, either in old or in new
editions, are hidden in the confusion. And because
of the talk the youngsters hear they want to read
the book their parents are reading, as they are curious
to read the daily paper, a thing never designed for
any schoolboy to do. For this reason they need
to be urged strongly to buy the book that is old and
tried by years of helpful reading.</p>

<p>The advertising appeal that persuades a buyer of
books to invest in what he does not want and cannot
use is active in two ways, through travelling agents
and at the book counters of department stores. Of
all the hindrances to the building up of a small
library out of savings for that purpose, the proverbial
book agent is the greatest. This master of the
art of persuasive perseverance, with his oilcloth
bag hidden under the frock of his coat, has filched
many a hard-earned dollar from the farmer. If he
had had either the artifice or the charity to get the
money and not deliver the book, the effect of his
pernicious activity would not be so marked. Yet
what he sells as a book takes its place on the centre-table
with others of its kind to waste the time of
winter evenings and wet days for a generation.
That interesting and rather convenient character,
the pedler with his pack, has passed away; but
the agent and his book continue to flourish. Can
no one propose a short way with book agents?</p>

<p>In the city the confusion is wrought by the woman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
agent and the girl clerk. Next to resisting civilly
the entreaties of the agent in black is for a man,
after having threaded that modern labyrinth, the
department store, and having halted at the book
counter to take his bearings, to be pounced upon
by the clerk in black before he has had time to thumb
a single volume, and asked if he has been waited
on. He watches the cosmopolitan stream of buyers
tossing about the cosmopolitan collection of book
bargains on the main aisle counter, and then retreats
in confusion to seek some old-fashioned book store
where he can loaf in ease and think of what he wants
to buy. Though scarcely willing to admit the claim
of many buyers and readers of books that it is not
good book-buying etiquette to purchase a book at
a department store, he feels at least that it is not a
quiet, convenient, and wise way. And the pity of
it all is, that out of this shuffle and clatter the child
is made the victim of the poor book that is bought
because it can be bought cheap.</p>

<p>The fairly well arranged book store is the one
place where a book for a boy may be bought in proper
form. Though the second-hand book store is an
interesting place for the man who has not the germ
fear, it is no place to get a boy's book. And the
old-fashioned book shop that must have been a joy
to the man of reading tastes has passed, as has the
old apothecary shop. From their modern offspring,
the book store and the drug store, we must get our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
books and our physic. It is on the shelves of these
book stores that buyers like to explore and make
discoveries of editions. If the particular edition
be known, a good way to buy is to order books directly
by mail from the publisher. In fact, this is what
often has to be done in small towns and in country
districts where well-stocked shelves are not within
reach. Yet few buyers can adjust themselves to
the practice of buying anything that they have not
seen. They like to feel the response of the book to
the touch, see the type and the illustrations and the
binding. This is all good where the store carries a
complete stock; but if every good book wanted has
to be ordered for the buyer, he might as well do it
himself directly from the publisher. From these
publishers good descriptive catalogues may be had
for the asking, and by means of them the book not
found at the store may be ordered.</p>

<p>At the usual book store, whether purely secular
or connected with the publishing house of a denominational
church, books for men are bought with
greater ease than books for children. A well-selected
list of titles for boys is seldom found. The ubiquitous
juveniles are lined up as usual, but good
reprints of children's classics are absent. The uninformed
buyer is at the mercy of the more uninformed
clerk. Out of the indecision of the one and the advice
of the other something wholly unfit for the boy is
bought. The poor book received as a gift is beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the boy's control and a delicate matter to handle;
but the buying of a poor book with good money is
a serious blunder. About the only safe way is to
know what you want before you go into the store,
dig it out from the shelves yourself, and have the clerk
do nothing but wrap it up and give you your change.
If you are not settled on what you want, get into the
habit of reading the book numbers of some journal
like <i>The Nation</i>, or consult with the well-informed
heads of the children's departments of public libraries.</p>

<p>The particular edition of a book to be bought is
largely a question of taste and of the money at the
command of the buyer. Many a boy sees little in
fine, well-illustrated editions. What he wants is
the story without regard to its dress. He may become
wedded to the poorly made, unattractive book
that has opened up new lands to him, just as many
a child has formed a greater attachment for a small
rag doll than for an expensive one of wax. Again,
circumstances may necessitate the buying of a
twenty-five or fifty-cent edition of a book instead
of a two or three dollar one. Yet this is true: if
the book is bought at a sacrifice and is to serve for
a lifetime (and no old book that has served its owner
well ought ever to be replaced by a new one), the
best edition available should be bought, even if it
is expensive. Of course, this largely depends on the
book. Mother Goose, some treasury of poetry,
&AElig;sop, stories from Shakespeare, a favourite collection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of fairy tales, and all such books often used need
to be in the best of editions; but the ones less often
read may be in cheaper form.</p>

<p>In selecting an edition the first thing to look to
is the type and paper. Even a standard edition
may be printed from worn plates giving an indistinct
impression. A clear-cut, large type on unglazed
paper is certainly the best. The detailed
colour illustration on a special sized plate-paper does
not appeal to the average child any more than do
the simpler black and white drawings done in a few
lines and put on the ordinary reading page. But the
best illustrations that are being done to-day are
very often done in colour, and at first glance they catch
the fancy of the child&mdash;then, too, they are the
fashion. Whatever kind they may be, illustrations
are almost necessary to a child's book. The next
consideration is the binding. What may have been
gained in attractiveness of page has surely been lost
in mechanical execution on binding. Books, even
high-priced books, are now cased instead of bound.
The machine-made back is hung to the book in an
insecure way. There is no hand shaping or building
of the back to the book. A child's book costing
three dollars will in a short time become loose,
hollow-backed, and the plate illustrations will fall
out. Hand-craft at a reasonable price has gone
by the way here as it has in many other fields of
workmanship. What the publisher has failed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
do in the binding of the book, the boy must be urged
to make up in the handling of it.</p>

<p>This brings up the question of the care of books.
Vandalism may do its work among books as well as
anywhere else. A good book deserves the best of
care and needs to be secure from the hand that
would soil or deface it. It is a friend to be kept in
comfortable quarters, and its rights are to be respected.
It is never to be used as a flower press
nor as a window stick; neither is it to have its back
carelessly broken nor its leaves turned down. It
was made to be read and to be enjoyed, and this
without regard to the fact that it came as a gift or
was bought with hard-earned money. The boy
should early be taught how to take care of it as he
would any other product of art.</p>

<p>The best-made book may be broken by opening
it carelessly the first time. Glue is flexible under
slow pressure, but will break under sudden strain.
If the book is taken in the middle and the halves
suddenly jerked open, it will be broken beyond
repair; but if the back of the book is placed on a
table and the leaves turned down slowly from both
covers to the centre, the glue will give and the book
will not be damaged. By going over the whole book
carefully in this way once or twice, it will be ready
for use. At no time, however, while reading, should
the covers or leaves be turned farther back than
they would be in lying flat open on a table. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
next thing for the boy to learn is how to take care
of the leaves of the book. The leaves should be
carefully turned with the dry tips of the fingers
from the top of the page and pressed down gently
but firmly. And under no circumstances should
the corner of a leaf be turned down to mark the
place where the reader left off&mdash;an interested memory
and a book mark are designed for that purpose.
To keep his books, every boy should have a book
shelf or two of his own that he can easily reach.
Any kind of home-made shelf will do; and in it
the books are to be set on end, never on the front of
the book, each in its particular place so that it might
be found in the dark. He ought to learn all of his
books by touch. After each reading the book is
to be carefully put in its stall and left there until
the owner chooses to take it out again.</p>

<p>When a book has been bought or received as a
gift, the boy should, according to the old style, write
therein his name, the date it came into his possession,
and the warning that it is his book. Book
plates are really unnecessary to a small library, unless
the owner can well afford them. But it is necessary
that the owner's name be written in each one. Now,
should the boy lend his book? It is a question
whether the refusal to lend it is a selfish act or not.
Like umbrellas, books are often looked on as stray
blessings to be taken in by any one who chances to
come across them or who needs them. The well-conceived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
chaining idea has long since disappeared,
but the purloining habit still lingers. It and its
handmaiden, borrowing, have wrought much confusion
and inconvenience in private libraries. Few
people ever think to return a book, or at least to
return it in good condition. If the truth were
always told, the couplet of the satirist would fit
the possessor of many a repleted library:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Next, o'er his books his eyes began to roll,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In pleasant memory of all he stole."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Selfish or not selfish, the wise thing for the boy to
do is to refuse to lend his books. It is too much
like lending a meal or a friend; but they can all be
shared in the presence of the owner. If the boy's
chum has a hungry mind and clean hands, he may
be asked to drop in and read the book where it belongs,
but not to carry it off elsewhere. Or better
still: the owner of the book who knows its riches
may fall into the habit of reading his favourite
portions aloud to his boy friends who have gathered
in for that purpose. No single thing will awaken
such a love for good literature as the gathering
of choice bits of it through the ear. That is the good
lesson that has come from the tent of the Arab. And
it is a lesson that readers must learn to-day. By
no means let the book of the boy fail to entertain
his chums, but let it entertain them at his own home.</div>

<p>Does any one who has laboured hard to build a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
house move out of it as soon as it is completed?
Does any one who has cultivated a friendship give it
up as soon as it is secure? Should any one who has
learned to thoroughly enjoy a good book throw it
aside as soon as this is done? Like the house or
the friend, that book should continue to be a comfort
to him who has learned to appreciate it. In short,
the boy must make friends with a few books and then
keep them without capitulation. If he does, he
may some day feel the truth of these verses:</p>

to judge of the good investment of knowledge than
of the good investment of money. In the desire
to appear as a good fellow among his companions
he disregards either economy of time or economy of
means. He needs to be shown the wisdom of saving
along both lines. This can be done in no better
way than by indicating to him an edition of a book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
that will require some sacrifice on his part to buy,
and maybe to find time to read. This may all have
to be done without regard to his tastes.</p>

<p>To let the mere notions of a boy determine the
edition of a book to be bought and to estimate the
merits of different editions by these same notions
is foolish. This is neither directing nor cultivating
tastes. The old plan of fencing in the pasture
and of not letting the boy wander too far afield was
many times a very good plan. Tastes need to be
directed and boundaries fixed. Instead of permitting
the boy to determine the merits of the illustrations
and the binding, he should have pointed out to him
repeatedly what good illustrations and good binding
are, and whether they can both be afforded.</p>

<p>Both tastes and circumstances may lead to the
buying of a cheap, modest-looking book. This may
serve its owner well, and he may never miss what
might be called the charm of a well-illustrated, well-printed,
and well-bound edition&mdash;one pleasant to
look into and to touch. He may be as little able
to judge of the artistic make-up of a book as of the
cut of his clothes or the quality of his food; what
he wants is something to satisfy hunger and to
cover nakedness, in whatever form it may be given.
Because of this the boy can bury himself in the
pages of an ill-made book if the words tell an enchanting
story. But it is safe to say that most boys
do like well-made books with good illustrations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>The pencil of the artist seems almost necessary
to give the right touch to a child's book that is great
literature. Not in that they enable the boy to get
the story more easily are illustrations valuable, but
in the fact that they lend an artistic touch to a thing
that is of itself a work of art. A guess, however, at
the kind of illustrations needed for children's books
would be very arbitrary. No one could hold that
the present-day coloured illustrations, with what is
termed life in action instead of decoration and convention,
are the only right ones for children. Nor
are the old line-drawings in black and white to be
discarded. We need woodcuts as well as the engraved
colour-plate; we need Cruikshank, Tenniel,
Greenaway, and Crane, as well as Brooke, Rackham,
Parrish, and Smith, for each has added a charm to
some of the great literature of childhood. May
children's books continue to fare well at the hands
of talented artists. No more enduring work can be
wrought than that in which a keen and sympathetic
imagination gives expression to a picture that was
first put into words.</p>

<p>The work in hand for the teacher is to secure the
buying of as good an edition of a book as the boy
can afford. The fact should be kept before him at
all times that he can usually get the good edition if
he is willing to do so. If it should happen that in
any particular year the boy cannot afford all of the
books that might be bought in that year, the teacher<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
should see that the one or two most valuable ones
are secured. For example, if he is a sixth-grade boy,
he must by some means manage to get "Robinson
Crusoe" and "The Arabian Nights' Entertainments."
The teacher's own interest, enthusiasm,
and good taste will successfully solve what is to be
done. As an aid in this direction it is to be hoped
that book stores will display a number of good
editions of each title of the standard books for children
in order that a more satisfactory choice may be
made of any one title. And the stores could do a
good turn by having well-informed and painstaking
clerks to aid in the selection of the right edition.</p>

<p>In the list that follows, a few low-priced editions
without illustrations are given as well as the more
artistic and expensive ones. The teacher may not
care to own the large illustrated edition that appeals
to the boy. Nor does he want an abridged
edition. He may have to depart from the list in
order to get a complete copy of such great books as
"Don Quixote." For this particular title the teacher
may range from the single volume of Motteaux's
translation in "Everyman's Library" (one of the
best issues of standard books for the teacher to
select from at a low price) to that of the excellent
translation by Shelton issued in the expensive "Tudor
Translations." So does he need some complete
edition of Lane's translation of "A Thousand and
One Nights" with Harvey's illustrations if possible,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
such as the three-volume edition imported by Scribner,
the four-volume edition in "Bohn's Standard
Library," or the six-volume edition in the "Ariel
Classics." Then again, it may happen that an edition
such as the two-shilling edition of Grimm
translated by Taylor and illustrated by Cruikshank,
issued by the Oxford Press, is as good for the teacher
as for the boy. But the appended list will not include
and designate editions suitable for teachers
only. The working out of such a list by the teacher
for himself will indicate his interest in the task that
is before him.</p>

<p>The list is not intended as a guide in building up
an extensive library for the use of children. Its
chief merit, no doubt, is in the fact that it is a limited
list. And its first good result must be in the practice
of the boy's buying a few books that are good
and that will be read and reread. But little comment
will be offered here and there on the preference
of one edition over another. All editions designated
by a star are well worth owning. A guess at the age
for reading a book has been made, but with considerable
latitude because of the unequal reading ability
among children. The age from six to ten years, the
primary grades of public school, will be indicated
by the letter "P" placed before the title; the age
from ten to fifteen years, the grammar grades of
school, will be indicated by the letter "G" placed
before the title. Any suggestions on included editions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
found unsatisfactory by experience, or on good
editions omitted, will be gladly received. The sole
aim herein is to present a list that will be of help to
the teacher and the boys under him in finding the
best that publishers have to give of the enduring
literature for children.</p>

<h3>FOUR WORTHIES</h3>

<div class='author2'>"<span class="smcap">&AElig;sop's Fables</span>"</div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>P&mdash;This enduring form of literature may be read in almost any grade.
The edition is to be determined largely by the grade for which it is designed.
In point of effectiveness in showing human experiences and weaknesses by
means of animal action, the classic fable has never been equalled by any
other form of literature. He would be a rash man who would claim that
Lincoln owed to Euclid more of his power to think out a question and
carry his point than he did to &AElig;sop. Fables are imaginative literature,
and in that lies their power rather than in their didactic assertion that
later became attached as a moral to be pointed. They need but one
moral, as G. K. Chesterton so aptly observes; for nothing in this world
has more than one moral.</p></div>

<div class='hang1'>*"The Fables of &AElig;sop." Selected and told anew by Joseph
Jacobs. Illustrated by Richard Heighway. 12mo.
Cloth, $1.50. In the New Cranford Series. Macmillan.

<div class="blockquot"><p>The boy who has read this capital story of adventure must of necessity
have more of Stevenson and had better try "Kidnapped" next. He may
sometime become absorbed in the wonderful tales of a favourite of Stevenson
himself, Dumas. Listen to the testimony of Thackeray about the
great French story-teller as it was written in the essay, "On a Lazy,
Idle Boy": "What was the book in the hands of my lad as he stood by
the river shore? Do you suppose that it was Livy, or the Greek grammar?
No: it was D'Artagnan locking up General Monk in a box, or
the prisoner of the Ch&acirc;teau d'If cutting himself out of the sack fifty feet
under water and swimming to the island of Monte Cristo. Be assured
the lazy boy was reading Dumas; and as for the tender pleadings of his
mother that he should not let his supper grow cold&mdash;I don't believe the
scapegrace cared one fig. No! Figs are sweet, but fictions are sweeter."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The great field of realistic fiction will later open up to the boy, but he
must be in no hurry to enter it. When he does enter it, however, see
that he selects well, and urge him to read in moderation. He might well
start with such books as "David Copperfield" and "The Mill on the
Floss," leaving Thackeray untouched for a few years until he can better
appreciate him. With a taste once formed for any one of these great
novelists, he will stand in little danger from the almost countless current
stories that are always getting in his way.</p></div>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
